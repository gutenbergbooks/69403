INTRODUCTION.
</h2>

<p>
Ten years have now elapsed since the first number of my
Illustrations of the Birds of America made its appearance. At
that period I calculated that the engravers would take sixteen
years in accomplishing their task; and this I announced in my
prospectus, and talked of to my friends. Of the latter not a
single individual seemed to have the least hope of my success,
and several strongly advised me to abandon my plans, dispose of
my drawings, and return to my country. I listened with attention
to all that was urged on the subject, and often felt deeply
depressed, for I was well aware of many of the difficulties to be
surmounted, and perceived that no small sum of money would
be required to defray the necessary expenses. Yet never did
I seriously think of abandoning the cherished object of my
hopes. When I delivered the first drawings to the engraver, I
had not a single subscriber. Those who knew me best called
me rash; some wrote to me that they did not expect to see a
second fasciculus; and others seemed to anticipate the total
failure of my enterprise. But my heart was nerved, and my
reliance on that Power, on whom all must depend, brought
bright anticipations of success.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vi' href='#Page_vi'>vi</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Having made arrangements for meeting the first difficulties,
I turned my attention to the improvement of my drawings, and
began to collect from the pages of my journals the scattered notes
which referred to the habits of the birds represented by them.
I worked early and late, and glad I was to perceive that the
more I laboured the more I improved. I was happy, too, to
find, that in general each succeeding plate was better than its
predecessor, and when those who had at first endeavoured to dissuade
me from undertaking so vast an enterprise, complimented
me on my more favourable prospects, I could not but feel happy.
Number after number appeared in regular succession, until at
the end of four years of anxiety, my engraver, Mr <span class="smcap">Havell</span>,
presented me with the First Volume of the Birds of America.
</p>

<p>
Convinced, from a careful comparison of the plates, that at
least there had been no falling off in the execution, I looked forward
with confidence to the termination of the next four years’
labour. Time passed on, and I returned from the forests and
wilds of the western world to congratulate my friend <span class="smcap">Havell</span>,
just when the last plate of the second volume was finished.
</p>

<p>
About that time, a nobleman called upon me with his family,
and requested me to shew them some of the original drawings,
which I did with the more pleasure that my visitors possessed
a knowledge of Ornithology. In the course of our conversation,
I was asked how long it might be until the work
should be finished. When I mentioned eight years more, the
nobleman shrugged up his shoulders, and sighing, said, “I may
not see it finished, but my children will, and you may please to
add my name to your list of subscribers.” The young people
exhibited a mingled expression of joy and sorrow, and when I
with them strove to dispel the cloud that seemed to hang over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_vii' href='#Page_vii'>vii</a></span>
their father’s mind, he smiled, bade me be sure to see that
the whole work should be punctually delivered, and took his
leave. The solemnity of his manner I could not forget for several
days; I often thought that neither might I see the work
completed, but at length I exclaimed “my sons may.” And
now that another volume, both of my Illustrations and of my
Biographies is finished, my trust in Providence is augmented,
and I cannot but hope that myself and my family together may
be permitted to see the completion of my labours.
</p>

<p>
I have performed no long journey since I last parted from you,
and therefore I have little of personal history to relate to you.
I have spent the greater part of the interval in London and
Edinburgh, in both which cities I have continued to enjoy a
social intercourse with many valued friends. In the former, it
has been my good fortune to add to the list the names of <span class="smcap">William
Yarrell</span>, Esq., Dr <span class="smcap">Bell</span>, Dr <span class="smcap">Boott</span>, Captain <span class="smcap">James
Clark Ross</span>, R. N., and Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>. From Mr <span class="smcap">Yarrell</span>
and the two latter gentlemen, both well known to you as
intrepid and successful travellers, I have received much valuable
information, as well as precious specimens of birds and eggs,
collected in the desolate regions of the extreme north. My
anxiety to compare my specimens with those of the Zoological
Society of London, induced me to request permission to do so,
which the Council freely accorded. For this favour I now present
my warm acknowledgments to the Noble <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of <span class="smcap">Derby</span>,
the Members of the Council, their amiable Secretary Mr <span class="smcap">Bennett</span>,
and to Mr <span class="smcap">Gould</span>, who had the kindness to select for me
such specimens as I wanted. My friend Professor <span class="smcap">Jameson</span> of
Edinburgh has been equally kind in allowing me the means of
comparing specimens. From America I have received some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_viii' href='#Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
valuable information, and many interesting specimens of birds
and eggs, for which I am indebted to the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>,
Dr <span class="smcap">Richard Harlan</span>, Dr <span class="smcap">George Parkman</span>, <span class="smcap">Edward
Harris</span>, Esq. and others.
</p>

<p>
The number of new species described in the present volume
is not great. Among them, however, you will find the largest
true Heron hitherto discovered in the United States. I have
corrected some errors committed by authors, and have added to
our Fauna several species which, although described by European
writers, had not been observed in America. The habits
of many species previously unknown have also been given in
detail.
</p>

<p>
Having long ago observed, in works on the Birds of the
United States, the omission of the females and the different appearances
produced by the change of season in most water birds,
I have represented the male accompanied by his mate, and, in
as many instances as possible, the young also. The technical
descriptions have been given at greater length than in the former
volumes, with the view of preventing error even in comparing
dried skins with either the figures or the descriptions.
I have also given the average measurement of the eggs, which
I regret I had omitted to do in the other volumes; an error
which I purpose to atone for by presenting you, in the last
number of my Illustrations, with figures of all those which I
have collected.
</p>

<p>
The figures in the third volume of my Illustrations amount
to one hundred and eighty-two, and are thus much fewer than
those in either of the preceding volumes. This, however,
was rendered necessary by the comparatively large size of the
originals, the aquatic species of Birds greatly exceeding the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_ix' href='#Page_ix'>ix</a></span>
terrestrial in this respect. Many of them in fact are so large
that only a single figure could be given, and that not always in
so good an attitude as I could have wished. For this reason I
have sometimes been obliged to give the figure of the young in
a separate plate; and this I shall in a few cases continue to do,
in order to correct the errors of authors respecting certain species,
which I have proved to be merely nominal. Still the number
contained in the three volumes being six hundred and
seventy-four, there are more than two to each species.
</p>

<p>
The engraving and colouring of the plates of this volume
have generally been considered as much superior even to those
of the second. Indeed, some of my patrons, both in Europe
and America, have voluntarily expressed their conviction of the
superiority of these plates. This is the more gratifying to me,
that it proves the unremitted care and perseverance of Mr
<span class="smcap">Havell</span> and his assistants, of whom I mention with approbation
Messrs <span class="smcap">Blake</span> and <span class="smcap">Edington</span>.
</p>

<p>
The Ornithology of the United States may be said to have
been commenced by <span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span>, whose premature
death prevented him from completing his labours. It is unnecessary
for me to say how well he performed the task which
he had imposed upon himself; for all naturalists, and many who
do not aspire to the name, acknowledge his great merits. But
although he succeeded in observing and obtaining a very great
number of our birds, he left for others many species which he
was unable to procure. These have been sought for with eagerness,
and not without success, by persons who have engaged in
the pursuit with equal ardour. The <span class="smcap">Prince of Musignano</span>,
full of enthusiasm, having his judgment matured by long observation,
and his mind stored with useful learning, collected in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_x' href='#Page_x'>x</a></span>
our woods and prairies, by our great rivers, and along our extended
shores, materials sufficient for four superb volumes, intended
as a continuation of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s work. <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>,
equally learned and enthusiastic, next entered the field. His
Manual of our Birds contains a mass of useful information, and
is for the most part excellent. Many others have, in various
ways, endeavoured to extend our knowledge on this subject;
but with the exception of <span class="smcap">Thomas Say</span>, none have published
their discoveries in a connected form. Dr <span class="smcap">Harlan</span> has given
to the world an excellent account of our Mammalia; various
works on Mollusca have appeared, and at present Dr <span class="smcap">Horlbeck</span>
of Charleston is engaged in publishing an account of our
Reptiles.
</p>

<p>
Along our extended frontiers I have striven to observe and
gather whatever had escaped the notice of the different collectors;
and now, kind Reader, to prove to you that if not so fortunate
as I had wished, I yet have done all that was in my
power, I present you with a third volume of Ornithological Biographies,
in which you will find some account of about sixty
species of Water Birds not included in the works of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>.
These, at one season or other, are to be met with along the
shores or streams of the United States. Some of them are certainly
very rare, others remarkable in form and habits; but all,
I trust, you will find distinct from each other, and not inaccurately
described.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties which are to be encountered in studying the
habits of our Water Birds are great. He who follows the feathered
inhabitants of the forests and plains, however rough or
tangled the paths may be, seldom fails to obtain the objects of
his pursuit, provided he be possessed of due enthusiasm and perseverance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xi' href='#Page_xi'>xi</a></span>
The Land Bird flits from bush to bush, runs before
you, and seldom extends its flight beyond the range of your
vision. It is very different with the Water Bird, which sweeps
afar over the wide ocean, hovers above the surges, or betakes itself
for refuge to the inaccessible rocks on the shore. There,
on the smooth sea-beach, you see the lively and active Sandpiper;
on that rugged promontory the Dusky Cormorant; under
the dark shade of yon cypress the Ibis and Heron; above
you in the still air floats the Pelican or the Swan; while far
over the angry billows scour the Fulmar and the Frigate bird.
If you endeavour to approach these birds in their haunts, they
betake themselves to flight, and speed to places where they are
secure from your intrusion.
</p>

<p>
But the scarcer the fruit, the more prized it is; and seldom
have I experienced greater pleasures than when on the Florida
Keys, under a burning sun, after pushing my bark for miles over
a soapy flat, I have striven all day long, tormented by myriads
of insects, to procure a heron new to me, and have at length succeeded
in my efforts. And then how amply are the labours of
the naturalist compensated, when, after observing the wildest
and most distrustful birds, in their remote and almost inaccessible
breeding places, he returns from his journeys, and relates
his adventures to an interested and friendly audience.
</p>

<p>
I look forward to the summer of 1838 with an anxious hope
that I may then be able to present you with the last plate of
my Illustrations, and the concluding volume of my Biographies.
To render these volumes as complete as possible, I intend to undertake
a journey to the southern and western limits of the
Union, with the view of obtaining a more accurate knowledge
of the birds of those remote and scarcely inhabited regions.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_xii' href='#Page_xii'>xii</a></span>
On this tour I shall be accompanied by my youngest son, while
the rest of my family will remain in Britain, to direct the progress
of my publication.
</p>

<p>
In concluding these prefatory remarks, I have to inform
you that one of the tail-pieces in my second volume, entitled
“A Moose Hunt,” was communicated to me by my young friend
<span class="smcap">Thomas Lincoln</span> of Dennisville in Maine; and that it was
at his particular request, and much against my wishes, that his
name was not mentioned at the time. I have now, however,
judged it proper to make this statement.

</p>

<p>
Although the Canada Goose is considered as a northern species, the
number of individuals that remain at all seasons in the milder latitudes,
and in different portions of the United States, fully entitles this bird to
be looked upon as a permanent resident there. It is found to breed sparingly
at the present day, by many of the lakes, lagoons, and large
streams of our Western Districts, on the Missouri, the Mississippi, the
lower parts of the Ohio, on Lake Erie, the lakes farther north, and in several
large pools situated in the interior of the eastern parts of the States
of Massachusetts and Maine. As you advance farther toward the east
and north, you find it breeding more abundantly. While on my way to
Labrador, I found it in the Magdeleine Islands, early in June, sitting on
its eggs. In the Island of Anticosti there is a considerable stream, near
the borders of which great numbers are said to be annually reared; and
in Labrador these birds breed in every suitable marshy plain. The
greater number of those which visit us from still more northern regions,
return in the vernal season, like many other species, to the dismal countries
which gave them birth.
</p>

<p>
Few if any of these birds spend the winter in Nova Scotia, my friend
Mr <span class="smcap">Thomas M’Culloch</span> having informed me that he never saw one about
Pictou at that period. In spring, as they proceed northward, thousands
are now and then seen passing high in the air; but in autumn, the flocks
are considerably smaller, and fly much lower. During their spring movements,
the principal places at which they stop to wait for milder days are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
Bay Chaleur, the Magdeleine Islands, Newfoundland, and Labrador, at
all of which some remain to breed and spend the summer.
</p>

<p>
The general spring migration of the Canada Goose, may be stated to
commence with the first melting of the snows in our Middle and Western
Districts, or from the 20th of March to the end of April; but the precise
time of its departure is always determined by the advance of the season,
and the vast flocks that winter in the great savannahs or swampy
prairies south-west of the Mississippi, such as exist in Opellousas, on the
borders of the Arkansas River, or in the dismal “Ever Glades” of the
Floridas, are often seen to take their flight, and steer their course northward,
a month earlier than the first of the above mentioned periods. It
is indeed probable that the individuals of a species most remote from the
point at which the greater number ultimately assemble, commence their
flight earlier than those which have passed the winter in stations nearer
to it.
</p>

<p>
It is my opinion that all the birds of this species, which leave our
States and territories each spring for the distant north, pair before they
depart. This, no doubt, necessarily results from the nature of their place
of summer residence, where the genial season is so short as scarcely to afford
them sufficient time for bringing up their young and renewing their
plumage, before the rigours of advancing winter force them to commence
their flight towards milder countries. This opinion is founded
on the following facts:—I have frequently observed large flocks of
Geese, in ponds, on marshy grounds, or even on dry sand bars, the mated
birds renewing their courtship as early as the month of January, while
the other individuals would be contending or coquetting for hours every
day, until all seemed satisfied with the choice they had made, after which,
although they remained together, any person could easily perceive that
they were careful to keep in pairs. I have observed also that the older
the birds, the shorter were the preliminaries of their courtship, and that
the barren individuals were altogether insensible to the manifestations of
love and mutual affection that were displayed around them. The bachelors
and old maids, whether in regret, or not caring to be disturbed by
the bustle, quietly moved aside, and lay down on the grass or sand at
some distance from the rest; and whenever the flocks rose on wing, or
betook themselves to the water, these forlorn birds always kept behind.
This mode of preparing for the breeding season has appeared to me the
more remarkable, that, on reaching the place appointed for their summer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
residence, the birds of a flock separate in pairs, which form their nests
and rear their young at a considerable distance from each other.
</p>

<p>
It is extremely amusing to witness the courtship of the Canada Goose
in all its stages; and let me assure you, reader, that although a Gander
does not strut before his beloved with the pomposity of a Turkey, or the
grace of a Dove, his ways are quite as agreeable to the female of his
choice. I can imagine before me one who has just accomplished the defeat
of another male after a struggle of half an hour or more. He advances
gallantly towards the object of contention, his head scarcely raised
an inch from the ground, his bill open to its full stretch, his fleshy tongue
elevated, his eyes darting fiery glances, and as he moves he hisses loudly,
while the emotion which he experiences, causes his quills to shake, and
his feathers to rustle. Now he is close to her who in his eyes is all loveliness;
his neck bending gracefully in all directions, passes all round her,
and occasionally touches her body; and as she congratulates him on his
victory, and acknowledges his affection, they move their necks in a hundred
curious ways. At this moment fierce jealousy urges the defeated
gander to renew his efforts to obtain his love; he advances apace, his
eye glowing with the fire of rage; he shakes his broad wings, ruffles up
his whole plumage, and as he rushes on the foe, hisses with the intensity
of anger. The whole flock seems to stand amazed, and opening up a
space, the birds gather round to view the combat. The bold bird who
has been caressing his mate, scarcely deigns to take notice of his foe, but
seems to send a scornful glance towards him. He of the mortified feelings,
however, raises his body, half opens his sinewy wings, and with a
powerful blow, sends forth his defiance. The affront cannot be borne in
the presence of so large a company, nor indeed is there much disposition
to bear it in any circumstances; the blow is returned with vigour, the
aggressor reels for a moment, but he soon recovers, and now the combat
rages. Were the weapons more deadly, feats of chivalry would now be
performed; as it is, thrust and blow succeed each other like the strokes
of hammers driven by sturdy forgers. But now, the mated gander has
caught hold of his antagonist’s head with his bill; no bull-dog could cling
faster to his victim; he squeezes him with all the energy of rage, lashes
him with his powerful wings, and at length drives him away, spreads out
his pinions, runs with joy to his mate, and fills the air with cries of exultation.
</p>

<p>
But now, see yonder, not a couple, but half a dozen of ganders are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
engaged in battle! Some desperado, it seems, has fallen upon a mated
bird, and several bystanders, as if sensible of the impropriety of such conduct,
rush to the assistance of the wronged one. How they strive and
tug, biting, and striking with their wings! and how their feathers fly
about! Exhausted, abashed, and mortified, the presumptuous intruder
retreats in disgrace;—there he lies almost breathless on the sand!
</p>

<p>
Such are the conflicts of these ardent lovers, and so full of courage
and of affection towards their females are they, that the approach of a
male invariably ruffles their tempers as well as their feathers. No sooner
has the goose laid her first egg, than her bold mate stands almost erect
by her side, watching even the rustling sound of the breeze. The least
noise brings from him a sound of anger. Should he spy a racoon making
its way among the grass, he walks up to him undauntedly, hurls a vigorous
blow at him, and drives him instantly away. Nay I doubt if man
himself, if unarmed, would come off unscathed in such an encounter.
The brave gander does more; for, if imminent danger excite him, he
urges his mate to fly off, and resolutely remains near the nest until he is
assured of her safety, when he also betakes himself to flight, mocking as
it were by his notes his disappointed enemy.
</p>

<p>
Suppose all to be peace and quiet around the fond pair, and the female
to be sitting in security upon her eggs. The nest is placed near
the bank of a noble stream or lake; the clear sky is spread over the
scene, the bright beams glitter on the waters, and a thousand odorous
flowers give beauty to the swamp which of late was so dismal. The gander
passes to and fro over the liquid element, moving as if lord of the
waters; now he inclines his head with a graceful curve, now sips to
quench his thirst; and, as noontide has arrived, he paddles his way towards
the shore, to relieve for a while his affectionate and patient consort.
The lisping sounds of their offspring are heard through the shell; their
little bills have formed a breach in the inclosing walls; full of life, and
bedecked with beauty, they come forth, with tottering steps and downy
covering. Toward the water they now follow their careful parent, they
reach the border of the stream, their mother already floats on the loved
element, one after another launches forth, and now the flock glides
gently along. What a beautiful sight! Close by the grassy margin,
the mother slowly leads her innocent younglings; to one she shews the
seed of the floating grass, to another points out the crawling slug. Her
careful eye watches the cruel turtle, the garfish, and the pike, that are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
lurking for their prey, and, with head inclined, she glances upwards to
the eagle or the gull that are hovering over the water in search of food.
A ferocious bird dashes at her young ones; she instantly plunges beneath
the surface, and, in the twinkling of an eye, her brood disappear after
her; now they are among the thick rushes, with nothing above water but
their little bills. The mother is marching towards the land, having lisped
to her brood in accents so gentle that none but they and her mate can
understand their import, and all are safely lodged under cover until the
disappointed eagle or gull bears away.
</p>

<p>
More than six weeks have now elapsed. The down of the goslings,
which was at first soft and tufty, has become coarse and hairlike. Their
wings are edged with quills, and their bodies bristled with feathers. They
have increased in size, and, living in the midst of abundance, they have
become fat, so that on shore they make their way with difficulty, and as
they are yet unable to fly, the greatest care is required to save them from
their numerous enemies. They grow apace, and now the burning days
of August are over. They are able to fly with ease from one shore to
another, and as each successive night the hoarfrosts cover the country,
and the streams are closed over by the ice, the family joins that in their
neighbourhood, which is also joined by others. At length they spy the
advance of a snow-storm, when the ganders with one accord sound the
order for their departure.
</p>

<p>
After many wide circlings, the flock has risen high in the thin air, and
an hour or more is spent in teaching the young the order in which they
are to move. But now, the host has been marshalled, and off it starts,
shewing, as it proceeds, at one time an extended front, at another a single
lengthened file, and now arraying itself in an angular form. The old
males advance in front, the females follow, the young come in succession
according to their strength, the weakest forming the rear. Should one
feel fatigued, his position is changed in the ranks, and he assumes a place
in the wake of another, who cleaves the air before him; perhaps the parent
bird flies for a while by his side to encourage him. Two, three, or
more days elapse before they reach a secure resting place. The fat with
which they were loaded at their departure has rapidly wasted; they are
fatigued, and experience the keen gnawings of hunger; but now they spy
a wide estuary, towards which they direct their course. Alighting on the
water, they swim to the beach, stand, and gaze around them; the young
full of joy, the old full of fear, for well are they aware that many foes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
have been waiting their arrival. Silent all night remains the flock, but
not inactive; with care they betake themselves to the grassy shores, where
they allay the cravings of appetite, and recruit their wasted strength.
Soon as the early dawn lightens the surface of the deep they rise into the
air, extend their lines, and proceed southward, until arriving in some place
where they think they may be enabled to rest in security, they remain
during the winter. At length, after many annoyances, they joyfully perceive
the return of spring, and prepare to fly away from their greatest
enemy, man.
</p>

<p>
The Canada Goose often arrives in our Western and Middle Districts
as early as the beginning of September, and does not by any means confine
itself to the seashore. Indeed, my opinion is, that for every hundred
seen during the winter along our large bays and estuaries, as many thousands
may be found in the interior of the country, where they frequent
the large ponds, rivers, and wet savannahs. During my residence in the
State of Kentucky, I never spent a winter without observing immense
flocks of these birds, especially in the neighbourhood of Henderson, where
I have killed many hundreds of them, as well as on the Falls of the Ohio
at Louisville, and in the neighbouring country, which abounds in ponds
overgrown with grasses and various species of Nympheæ, on the seeds of
which they greedily feed. Indeed all the lakes situated within a few miles
of the Missouri and Mississippi, or their tributaries, are still amply supplied
with them from the middle of autumn to the beginning of spring.
In these places, too, I have found them breeding, although sparingly.
It seems to me more than probable, that the species bred abundantly in
the temperate parts of North America before the white population extended
over them. This opinion is founded on the relations of many old
and respectable citizens of our country, and in particular of General
<span class="smcap">George Clark</span>, one of the first settlers on the banks of the Ohio, who,
at a very advanced age, assured me that, fifty years before the period
when our conversation took place (about seventy-five years from the present
time), wild geese were so plentiful at all seasons of the year, that he
was in the habit of having them shot to feed his soldiers, then garrisoned
near Vincennes, in the present State of Indiana. My father, who travelled
down the Ohio shortly after <span class="smcap">Bradock</span>’s defeat, related the same to
me; and I, as well as many persons now residing at Louisville in Kentucky,
well remember that, twenty-five or thirty years ago, it was quite
easy to procure young Canada Geese in the ponds around. So late as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
1819, I have met with the nests, eggs, and young of this species near
Henderson. However, as I have already said, the greater number remove
far north to breed. I have never heard of an instance of their
breeding in the Southern States. Indeed, so uncongenial to their constitution
seems the extreme heat of these parts to be, that the attempts made
to rear them in a state of domestication very rarely succeed.
</p>

<p>
The Canada Goose, when it remains with us to breed, begins to form
its nest in March, making choice of some retired place not far from the
water, generally among the rankest grass, and not unfrequently under a
bush. It is carefully formed of dry plants of various kinds, and is of a
large size, flat, and raised to the height of several inches. Once only did
I find a nest elevated above the ground. It was placed on the stump of
a large tree, standing in the centre of a small pond, about twenty feet
high, and contained five eggs. As the spot was very secluded, I did not
disturb the birds, anxious as I was to see in what manner they should
convey the young to the water. But in this I was disappointed, for, on
going to the nest, near the time at which I expected the process of incubation
to terminate, I had the mortification to find that a racoon, or some
other animal, had destroyed the whole of the eggs, and that the birds had
abandoned the place. The greatest number of eggs which I have found
in the nest of this species was nine, which I think is more by three than
these birds usually lay in a wild state. In the nests of those which I
have had in a domesticated state, I have sometimes counted as many as
eleven, several of them, however, usually proving unproductive. The
eggs measure, on an average,
<span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches by
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>, are thick shelled, rather
smooth, and of a very dull yellowish-green colour. The period of incubation
is twenty-eight days. They never have more than one brood in a
season, unless their eggs are removed or broken at an early period.
</p>

<p>
The young follow their parents to the water a day or two after they
have issued from the egg, but generally return to land to repose in the
sunshine in the evening, and pass the night there under their mother, who
employs all imaginable care to ensure their comfort and safety, as does
her mate, who never leaves her during incubation for a longer time than
is necessary for procuring food, and takes her place at intervals. Both
remain with their brood until the following spring. It is during the
breeding-season that the gander displays his courage and strength to the
greatest advantage. I knew one that appeared larger than usual, and of
which all the lower parts were of a rich cream colour. It returned three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
years in succession to a large pond a few miles from the mouth of
Green River in Kentucky, and whenever I visited the nest, it seemed to
look upon me with utter contempt. It would stand in a stately attitude,
until I reached within a few yards of the nest, when suddenly lowering
its head, and shaking it as if it were dislocated from the neck, it would
open its wings, and launch into the air, flying directly at me. So daring
was this fine fellow, that in two instances he struck me a blow with one
of his wings on the right arm, which, for an instant, I thought, was
broken. I observed that immediately after such an effort to defend his
nest and mate, he would run swiftly towards them, pass his head and neck
several times over and around the female, and again assume his attitude
of defiance.
</p>

<p>
Always intent on making experiments, I thought of endeavouring to
conciliate this bold son of the waters. For this purpose I always afterwards
took with me several ears of corn, which I shelled, and threw towards
him. It remained untouched for several days; but I succeeded at last,
and before the end of a week both birds fed freely on the grain even
in my sight! I felt much pleasure on this occasion, and repeating my
visit daily, found, that before the eggs were hatched, they would allow
me to approach within a few feet of them, although they never suffered
me to touch them. Whenever I attempted this the male met my fingers
with his bill, and bit me so severely that I gave it up. The great
beauty and courage of the male rendered me desirous of obtaining possession
of him. I had marked the time at which the young were likely
to appear, and on the preceding day I baited with corn a large coop
made of twine, and waited until he should enter. He walked in, I
drew the string, and he was my prisoner. The next morning the female
was about to lead her offspring to the river, which was distant nearly half
a mile, when I caught the whole of the young birds, and with them the
mother too, who came within reach in attempting to rescue one of her
brood, and had them taken home. There I took a cruel method of preventing
their escape, for with a knife I pinioned each of them on the
same side, and turned them loose in my garden, where I had a small but
convenient artificial pond. For more than a fortnight, both the old birds
appeared completely cowed. Indeed, for some days I felt apprehensive
that they would abandon the care of the young ones. However, with
much attention, I succeeded in rearing the latter by feeding them abundantly
with the larvæ of locusts, which they ate greedily, as well as with
corn-meal moistened with water, and the whole flock, consisting of eleven
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
individuals, went on prosperously. In December the weather became intensely
cold, and I observed that now and then the gander would spread
his wings, and sound a loud note, to which the female first, and then all
the young ones in succession, would respond, when they would all run
as far as the ground allowed them in a southerly direction, and attempt
to fly off. I kept the whole flock three years. The old pair never
bred while in my possession, but two pairs of the young ones did, one
of them raising three, the other seven. They all bore a special enmity
to dogs, and shewed dislike to cats; but they manifested a still greater
animosity towards an old swan and a wild turkey-cock which I had. I
found them useful in clearing the garden of slugs and snails; and although
they now and then nipped the vegetables, I liked their company.
When I left Henderson, my flock of geese was given away, and I have
not since heard how it has fared with them.
</p>

<p>
On one of my shooting excursions in the same neighbourhood, I chanced
one day to kill a wild Canada Goose, which, on my return, was sent
to the kitchen. The cook, while dressing it, found in it an egg ready
for being laid, and brought it to me. It was placed under a common
hen, and in due time hatched. Two years afterwards the bird thus raised,
mated with a male of the same species, and produced a brood. This
goose was so gentle that she would suffer any person to caress her, and
would readily feed from the hand. She was smaller than usual, but in
every other respect as perfect as any I have ever seen. At the period of
migration she shewed by her movements less desire to fly off than any
other I have known; but her mate, who had once been free, did not participate
in this apathy.
</p>

<p>
I have not been able to discover why many of those birds which I have
known to have been reared from the egg, or to have been found when very
young and brought up in captivity, were so averse to reproduce, unless
they were naturally sterile. I have seen several that had been kept for more
than eight years, without ever mating during that period, while other individuals
had young the second spring after their birth. I have also observed
that an impatient male would sometimes abandon the females of his species,
and pay his addresses to a common tame goose, by which a brood would
in due time be brought up, and would thrive. That this tardiness is not
the case in the wild state I feel pretty confident, for I have observed having
broods of their own many individuals which, by their size, the dulness
of their plumage, and such other marks as are known to the practical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
ornithologist, I judged to be not more than fifteen or sixteen months
old. I have therefore thought that in this, as in many other species, a
long series of years is necessary for counteracting the original wild and
free nature which has been given them; and indeed it seems probable
that our attempts to domesticate many species of wild fowls, which would
prove useful to mankind, have often been abandoned in despair, when a
few years more of constant care might have produced the desired effect.
</p>

<p>
The Canada Goose, although immediately after the full development
of its young it becomes gregarious, does not seem to be fond of the company
of any other species. Thus, whenever the White-fronted Goose,
the Snow Goose, the Brent Goose, or others, alight in the same ponds, it
forces them to keep at a respectful distance; and during its migrations I
have never observed a single bird of any other kind in its ranks.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species of Goose is firm, rather rapid, and capable
of being protracted to a great extent. When once high in the air, they
advance with extreme steadiness and regularity of motion. In rising
from the water or from the ground, they usually run a few feet with outspread
wings; but when suddenly surprised and in full plumage, a single
spring on their broad webbed feet is sufficient to enable them to get
on wing. While travelling to some considerable distance, they pass
through the air at the height of about a mile, steadily following a direct
course towards the point to which they are bound. Their notes are distinctly
heard, and the various changes made in the disposition of their
ranks are easily seen. But although on these occasions they move with
the greatest regularity, yet when they are slowly advancing from south
to north at an early period of the season, they fly much lower, alight
more frequently, and are more likely to be bewildered by suddenly formed
banks of fog, or by passing over cities or arms of the sea where much
shipping may be in sight. On such occasions great consternation prevails
among them, they crowd together in a confused manner, wheel irregularly,
and utter a constant cackling resembling the sounds from a disconcerted
mob. Sometimes the flock separates, some individuals leave the rest, proceed
in a direction contrary to that in which they came, and after a while,
as if quite confused, sail towards the ground, once alighted on which they
appear to become almost stupified, so as to suffer themselves to be shot
with ease, or even knocked down with sticks. This I have known to take
place on many occasions, besides those of which I have myself been a witness.
Heavy snow-storms also cause them great distress, and in the midst
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
of them some have been known to fly against beacons and lighthouses,
dashing their heads against the walls in the middle of the day. In the
night they are attracted by the lights of these buildings, and now and then
a whole flock is caught on such occasions. At other times their migrations
northward are suddenly checked by a change of weather, the approach
of which seems to be well known to them, for they will suddenly
wheel and fly back in a southern direction several hundred miles. In
this manner I have known flocks to return to the places which they had
left a fortnight before. Nay even during the winter months, they are
keenly sensible to changes of temperature, flying north or south in search
of feeding-grounds, with so much knowledge of the future state of the
weather, that one may be assured when he sees them proceeding southward
in the evening, that the next morning will be cold, and <i>vice versa</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Canada Goose is less shy when met with far inland, than when
on the sea-coast, and the smaller the ponds or lakes to which they resort,
the more easy it is to approach them. They usually feed in the manner
of Swans and fresh-water Ducks, that is, by plunging their heads towards
the bottom of shallow ponds or the borders of lakes and rivers, immersing
their fore parts, and frequently exhibiting their legs and feet with the
posterior portion of their body elevated in the air. They never dive on
such occasions. If feeding in the fields or meadows, they nip the blades
of grass sidewise, in the manner of the Domestic Goose, and after rainy
weather, they are frequently seen rapidly patting the earth with both
feet, as if to force the earth-worms from their burrows. If they dabble
at times with their bills in muddy water, in search of food, this action is
by no means so common with them as it is with Ducks, the Mallard for
example. They are extremely fond of alighting in corn-fields covered
with tender blades, where they often remain through the night and commit
great havoc. Wherever you find them, and however remote from
the haunts of man the place may be, they are at all times so vigilant and
suspicious, that it is extremely rare to surprise them. In keenness of
sight and acuteness of hearing, they are perhaps surpassed by no bird
whatever. They act as sentinels towards each other, and during the
hours at which the flock reposes, one or more ganders stand on the watch.
At the sight of cattle, horses, or animals of the deer kind, they are seldom
alarmed, but a bear or a cougar is instantly announced, and if on
such occasions the flock is on the ground near water, the birds immediately
betake themselves in silence to the latter, swim to the middle of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
the pond or river, and there remain until danger is over. Should their
enemies pursue them in the water, the males utter loud cries, and the
birds arrange themselves in close ranks, rise simultaneously in a few seconds,
and fly off in a compact body, seldom at such times forming lines
or angles, it being in fact only when the distance they have to travel is
great that they dispose themselves in those forms. So acute is their sense
of hearing, that they are able to distinguish the different sounds or footsteps
of their foes with astonishing accuracy. Thus the breaking of a
dry stick by a deer is at once distinguished from the same accident occasioned
by a man. If a dozen of large turtles drop into the water, making
a great noise in their fall, or if the same effect is produced by an alligator,
the Wild Goose pays no regard to it; but however faint and distant may
be the sound of an Indian’s paddle, that may by accident have struck the
side of his canoe, it is at once marked, every individual raises its head
and looks intently towards the place from which the noise has proceeded,
and in silence all watch the movements of their enemy.
</p>

<p>
These birds are extremely cunning also, and should they conceive
themselves unseen, they silently move into the tall grasses by the margin
of the water, lower their heads, and lie perfectly quiet until the boat has
passed by. I have seen them walk off from a large frozen pond into the
woods, to elude the sight of the hunter, and return as soon as he had
crossed the pond. But should there be snow on the ice or in the woods,
they prefer watching the intruder, and take to wing long before he is
within shooting distance, as if aware of the ease with which they could be
followed by their tracks over the treacherous surface.
</p>

<p>
The Canada Geese are fond of returning regularly to the place which
they have chosen for resting in, and this they continue to do until they
find themselves greatly molested while there. In parts of the country
where they are little disturbed, they seldom go farther than the nearest
sandbank or the dry shore of the places in which they feed; but in other
parts they retire many miles to spots of greater security, and of such extent
as will enable them to discover danger long before it can reach them.
When such a place is found, and proves secure, many flocks resort to it,
but alight apart in separate groups. Thus, on some of the great sandbars
of the Ohio, the Mississippi, and other large streams, congregated
flocks, often amounting to a thousand individuals, may be seen at the approach
of night, which they spend there, lying on the sand within a few
feet of each other, every flock having its own sentinel. In the dawn of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
next morning they rise on their feet, arrange and clean their feathers,
perhaps walk to the water to drink, and then depart for their feeding
grounds.
</p>

<p>
When I first went to the Falls of the Ohio, the rocky shelvings of
which are often bare for fully half a mile, thousands of wild geese of this
species rested there at night. The breadth of the various channels that
separate the rocky islands from either shore, and the rapidity of the currents
which sweep along them, render this place of resort more secure
than most others. The wild geese still betake themselves to these islands
during winter for the same purpose, but their number has become very
small; and so shy are these birds at present in the neighbourhood of
Louisville, that the moment they are disturbed at the ponds where they
go to feed each morning, were it but by the report of a single gun, they
immediately return to their rocky asylums. Even there, however, they
are by no means secure, for it not unfrequently happens that a flock
alights within half gunshot of a person concealed in a pile of drifted wood,
whose aim generally proves too true for their peace. Nay, I knew a gentleman,
who had a large mill opposite Rock Island, and who used to kill
the poor geese at the distance of about a quarter of a mile, by means of
a small cannon heavily charged with rifle bullets; and, if I recollect truly,
Mr <span class="smcap">Tarascon</span> in this manner not unfrequently obtained a dozen or more
geese at a shot. This was done at dawn, when the birds were busily engaged
in trimming their plumage with the view of flying off in a few minutes
to their feeding grounds. This war of extermination could not last
long: the geese deserted the fatal rock, and the great gun of the mighty
miller was used only for a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
While on the water, the Canada Goose moves with considerable grace,
and in its general deportment resembles the wild Swan, to which I think
it is nearly allied. If wounded in the wing, they sometimes dive to a
small depth, and make off with astonishing address, always in the direction
of the shore, the moment they reach which, you see them sneaking
through the grass or bushes, their necks extended an inch or so above the
ground, and in this manner proceeding so silently, that, unless closely
watched, they are pretty sure to escape. If shot at and wounded while
on the ice, they immediately walk off in a dignified manner, as if anxious
to make you believe that they have not been injured, emitting a loud note
all the while; but the instant they reach the shore they become silent,
and make off in the manner described. I was much surprised one day,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
while on the coast of Labrador, to see how cunningly one of these birds,
which, in consequence of the moult, was quite unable to fly, managed for
a while to elude our pursuit. It was first perceived at some distance from
the shore, when the boat was swiftly rowed towards it, and it swam before
us with great speed, making directly towards the land; but when we
came within a few yards of it, it dived, and nothing could be seen of it
for a long time. Every one of the party stood on tiptoe to mark the spot
at which it should rise, but all in vain, when the man at the rudder
accidentally looked down over the stern and there saw the goose, its
body immersed, the point of its bill alone above water, and its feet busily
engaged in propelling it so as to keep pace with the movements of the
boat. The sailor attempted to catch it while within a foot or two of him,
but with the swiftness of thought it shifted from side to side, fore and aft,
until delighted at having witnessed so much sagacity in a goose, I begged
the party to suffer the poor bird to escape.

<p>
The crossing of the Canada Goose with the common domestic species
has proved as advantageous as that of the wild with the tame Turkey,
the cross breed being much larger than the original one, more easily raised,
and more speedily fattened. This process is at present carried on to a considerable
extent in our Western and Eastern States, where the hybrids are
regularly offered for sale during autumn and winter, and where they bring
a higher price than either of the species from which they are derived.
</p>

<p>
The Canada Goose makes its first appearance in the western country,
as well as along our Atlantic coast, from the middle of September to that
of October, arriving in flocks composed of a few families. The young
birds procured at this early season soon get into good order, become tender
and juicy, and therefore afford excellent eating. If a sportsman is
expert and manages to shoot the old birds first, he is pretty sure to capture
the less wily young ones afterwards, as they will be very apt to return
to the same feeding places to which their parents had led them at
their first arrival. To await their coming to a pond where they are known
to feed is generally effectual, but to me this mode of proceeding never
afforded much pleasure, more especially because the appearance of any
other bird which I wished to obtain would at once induce me to go after
it, and thus frighten the game, so that I rarely procured any on such occasions.
But yet, as I have witnessed the killing of many a fine goose, I
hope you will suffer me to relate one or two anecdotes connected with the
shooting of this kind of game.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Reader, I am well acquainted with one of the best sportsmen now
living in the whole of the western country, one possessed of strength, activity,
courage, and patience,—qualities of great importance in a gunner.
I have frequently seen him mount a capital horse of speed and bottom at
midnight, when the mercury in the thermometer was about the freezing
point, and the ground was covered with snow and ice, the latter of
which so encased the trees that you might imagine them converted into
glass. Well, off he goes at a round gallop, his steed rough shod, but nobody
knows whither, save myself, who am always by his side. He has a
wallet containing our breakfast, and abundance of ammunition, together
with such implements as are necessary on occasions like the present. The
night is pitch-dark, and dismal enough; but who cares! <i>He</i> knows the
woods as well as any Kentucky hunter, and in this respect I am not much
behind him. A long interval has passed, and now the first glimpse of day
appears in the east. We know quite well where we are, and that we have
travelled just twenty miles. The Barred Owl alone interrupts the melancholy
silence of the hour. Our horses we secure, and on foot we move
cautiously towards a “long pond,” the feeding-place of several flocks of
geese, none of which have yet arrived, although the whole surface of open
water is covered with Mallards, Widgeons, Pintail Ducks, Blue-winged
and Green-winged Teals. My friend’s gun, like mine, is a long and
trusty one, and the opportunity is too tempting. On all fours we cautiously
creep to the very edge of the pond; we now raise ourselves on
our knees, level our pieces, and let fly. The woods resound with repeated
echoes, the air is filled with Ducks of all sorts, our dogs dash
into the half frozen water, and in a few minutes a small heap of game
lies at our feet. Now, we retire, separate, and betake ourselves to different
sides of the pond. If I may judge of my companion’s fingers by
the state of my own, I may feel certain that it would be difficult for
him to fasten a button. There we are shivering, with contracted feet and
chattering teeth; but the geese are coming, and their well known cry,
<i>hauk, hauk, awhawk, awhawk</i>, resounds through the air. They wheel
and wheel for a while, but at length gracefully alight on the water,
and now they play and wash themselves, and begin to look about for
food. There must be at least twenty of them. Twenty more soon arrive,
and in less than half an hour we have before us a flock of a hundred
individuals. My experienced friend has put a snow-white shirt over his
apparel, and although I am greatly intent on observing his motions, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
see that it is impossible even for the keen eye of the sentinel goose to follow
them. Bang, bang, quoth his long gun, and the birds in dismay instantly
start, and fly towards the spot where I am. When they approach
I spring up on my feet, the geese shuffle, and instantaneously rise upright;
I touch my triggers singly, and broken-winged and dead two birds come
heavily to the ground at my feet. Oh that we had more guns! But the
business at this pond has been transacted. We collect our game, return
to our horses, fasten the necks of the geese and ducks together, and throwing
them across our saddles, proceed towards another pond. In this
manner we continue to shoot until the number of geese obtained would
seem to you so very large that I shall not specify it.
</p>

<p>
At another time my friend proceeds alone to the Falls of the Ohio,
and, as usual, reaches the margins of the stream long before day. His
well-trained steed plunges into the whirls of the rapid current, and, with
some difficulty, carries his bold rider to an island, where he lands drenched
and cold. The horse knows what he has to do as well as his master,
and while the former ranges about and nips the frozen herbage, the latter
carefully approaches a well-known pile of drifted wood, and conceals
himself in it. His famous dog Nep is close at his heels. Now the dull
grey dawn gives him a dim view of the geese; he fires, several fall on the
spot, and one severely wounded rises and alights in the Indian Chute.
Neptune dashes after it, but as the current is powerful, the gunner whistles
to his horse, who, with pricked ears, gallops up. He instantly vaults
into the saddle, and now see them plunge into the treacherous stream.
The wounded game is overtaken, the dog is dragged along, and at length
on the Indiana shore the horse and his rider have effected a landing. Any
other man than he of whose exploits I am the faithful recorder, would
have perished long ago. But it is not half so much for the sake of the
plunder that he undergoes all this labour and danger, as for the gratification
it affords his kind heart to distribute the game among his numerous
friends in Louisville.
</p>

<p>
On our eastern shores matters are differently managed. The gunners
there shoot geese with the prospect of pecuniary gain, and go to work in
another way. Some attract them with wooden geese, others with actual
birds; they lie in ambush for many hours at a time, and destroy an
immense number of them, by using extremely long guns; but as there is
little sport in this sort of shooting, I shall say no more about it. Here
the Canada Goose feeds much on a species of long slender grass, the <i>Zostera
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
marina</i>, along with marine insects, crustacea, and small shell-fish,
all of which have a tendency to destroy the agreeable flavour which their
flesh has when their food consists of fresh-water plants, corn, and grass.
They spend much of their time at some distance from the shores, become
more shy, diminish in bulk, and are much inferior as food to those which
visit the interior of the country. None of these, however, are at all to
be compared with the goslings bred in the inland districts, and procured
in September, when, in my opinion, they far surpass the renowned Canvass-backed
Duck.
</p>

<p>
A curious mode of shooting the Canada Goose I have practised with
much success. I have sunk in the sand of the bars to which these birds
resort at night, a tight hogshead, to within an inch of its upper edges,
and placing myself within it at the approach of evening, have drawn over
me a quantity of brushwood, placing my gun on the sand, and covering
it in like manner with twigs and leaves. The birds would sometimes
alight very near me, and in this concealment I have killed several at a
shot; but the stratagem answers for only a few nights in the season. During
severe winters these birds are able to keep certain portions of the
deepest parts of a pond quite open and free from ice, by their continued
movements in the water; at all events, such open spaces occasionally occur
in ponds and lakes, and are resorted to by the geese, among which
great havoc is made.
</p>

<p>
It is alleged in the State of Maine that a distinct species of Canada
Goose resides there, which is said to be much smaller than the one now
under your notice, and is described as resembling it in all other particulars.
Like the true Canada Goose, it builds a large nest, which it lines
with its own down. Sometimes it is placed on the sea-shore, at other
times by the margin of a fresh-water lake or pond. That species is distinguished
there by the name of <i>Flight Goose</i>, and is said to be entirely
migratory, whereas the Canada Goose is resident. But, notwithstanding
all my exertions, I did not succeed in procuring so much as a feather of
this alleged species.
</p>

<p>
While we were at Newfoundland, on our return from Labrador, on
the 15th August 1833, small flocks of the Canada Goose were already
observed flying southward. In that country their appearance is hailed
with delight, and great numbers of them are shot. They breed rather
abundantly by the lakes of the interior of that interesting country. In
the harbour of Great Macatina in Labrador, I saw a large pile of young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
Canada Geese, that had been procured a few days before, and were already
salted for winter use. The pile consisted of several hundred individuals,
all of which had been killed before they were able to fly. I was
told there that this species fed much on the leaves of the dwarf firs, and,
on examining their gizzards, found the statement to be correct.
</p>

<p>
The young dive very expertly, soon after their reaching the water, at
the least appearance of danger. In the Southern and Western States, the
enemies of the Canada Goose are, by water, the Alligator, the Garfish,
and the Turtle; and on land, the Cougar, the Lynx, and the Racoon.
While in the air, they are liable to be attacked by the White-headed
Eagle. It is a very hardy bird, and individuals have been kept in a state
of captivity or domestication for upwards of forty years. Every portion
of it is useful to man, for besides the value of the flesh as an article of
food, the feathers, the quills, and the fat, are held in request. The eggs
also afford very good eating.

<p class="p2">
Whilst the icicles are yet hanging from the rocks of our eastern
shores, and the snows are gradually giving way under the influence of
the April rains, the Bluebird is heard to sound the first notes of his love-song,
and the Red-throated Diver is seen to commence his flight. Already
paired, the male and female, side by side, move swiftly through
the air, steering their course, at a great height, towards some far distant
region of the dreary north. Pair after pair advance at intervals during
the whole day, and perhaps continue their journey all night. Their long
necks are extended, their feet stretched out rudder-like beyond the short
tail, and onwards they speed, beating the air with great regularity. Now
they traverse a great arm of the sea, now cross a peninsula; but let what
may intervene, their undeviating course holds straight forwards, as the
needle points to its pole. High as they are, you can perceive the brilliant
white of their lower parts. Onward they speed in silence, and as I stand
gazing after them, they have already disappeared from my view.
</p>

<p>
The middle of May has arrived; our woods are once more filled with
the melodies of numberless warblers, and the Divers have ceased to be
seen on our eastern coasts. To study their habits at this season, we must
follow them to the islands in the mouth of the broad St Lawrence, or to
the granitic rocks of Labrador. The voyage cannot be performed without
great expense, and may be attended with danger, but enthusiasm
urges me on, and now my bark skims over the blue waters. At length
arrived on the rocky shores, I prepare to visit the interior of that rude
and moss-clad region. Thousands of little lakes are seen, on which are
numberless islets richly clad with grass and sedge, the whole of which
seems as if it had grown in a day, so tender are the fresh blades, and so
pure their light green tint. High over these waters, the produce of the
melted snows, the Red-throated Diver is seen gambolling by the side of
his mate. The males emit their love-notes, and, with necks gracefully
curved downwards, speed by the females, saluting them with mellow tones
as they pass. In broad circles they wheel their giddy flight, and now,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
with fantastic glidings and curves, they dive towards the spot of their
choice. Alighted on the water, how gracefully they swim, how sportively
they beat it with their strong pinions, how quickly they plunge and
rise again, and how joyously do they manifest to each other the depth
and intensity of their affection! Now with erected neck and body deeply
immersed they swim side by side. Reynard they perceive cunningly advancing
at a distance; but they are too vigilant for him, and down like
a flash they go, nor rise again until far beyond his reach. Methinks I
see them curiously concealed among the rank weeds under the bank of
their own islet, their bills alone raised above the water, and there will
they remain for an hour, rather than shew themselves to their insidious
enemy, who, disappointed, leaves them to pursue their avocations.
</p>

<p>
The Red-throated Diver is found, in tolerable abundance, on the sea-coast
of the United States during autumn, winter, and early spring, from
Maryland to the extremities of Maine. The younger the birds, the farther
south do they proceed to spend the winter, and it is rare to see an
old bird, of either sex, at any season to the south of the Bay of Boston.
Farther eastward they become more common, and they may be said to be
plentiful towards the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, in the vicinity of
which a few remain and breed. I found some in December, January,
and February at Boston, where I procured males, females, and young
birds. The old had the red patch on the throat rather darker than in
the breeding season; the delicate grey and white lines on the neck were
as pure as I observed them to be during summer in Labrador; and I
have since been convinced that birds of this family undergo very little if
any change of colouring after they have once acquired their perfect
plumage, the Loon and the Black-throated Diver being included in this
remark; while, on the contrary, all the Grebes with which I am acquainted,
lose the beauty of their plumage as soon as the breeding season
is over. This remarkable difference between the Divers and the Grebes
would of itself be sufficient to separate the two genera, were there not
also other distinctions. The Divers, moreover, live on the sea during the
greater part of the year, and resort to ponds, lakes, or the borders of
rivers to breed; whilst the Grebes spend most of their time on inland
lakes, marshes, and streams. Immediately after the breeding season, as
soon as the young are able to fly, the families of Divers make their way
to the arms and inlets of the sea, rarely entering the fresh waters until
the following spring.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Red-throated Diver is at all times an extremely shy and vigilant
bird, ever on the alert to elude its numerous enemies. The sight of
man seems invariably to alarm it, even in the wildest countries in which
it breeds. I have often observed that, while yet several hundred yards
from them, they marked my approach with great watchfulness. First
they would dive and make their way to the farther end of the pond, after
which, with outstretched necks, they would remain silent and motionless,
until I approached within about a hundred yards, when, instead of diving
again, as the Loon always does, they at once, with a single spring, rose
from the water, and ere I had proceeded a few yards, they were already
eight or ten feet above it. If I crept towards them through the tangled
mosses or shrubs, they would swim about with their heads elevated, as if
determined to make their escape on the appearance of imminent danger.
In many instances, my party observed this species in small flocks of five
or six in the same lake, when it happened to be of considerable extent;
and as this was during the height of the breeding season, we concluded
that these associated birds were barren, as I ascertained that males and
females, when once paired, remain together until their young are able to
fly, when they part company, until the next pairing season, which is about
the first of March.
</p>

<p>
This species begins to breed in Labrador in the beginning of June,
and about a fortnight earlier along the Bay of Fundy. The numerous
nests which our party found in the former district were all placed on
small sequestered islands in the middle of lakes or large ponds of fresh
water, rarely more than one mile distant from the sea-shore. These nests
consisted merely of a few blades of rank grasses loosely put together, and
were quite flat, without any down to warm or conceal the eggs at any period
of incubation. The nest was placed within a few feet of the water,
and well-beaten tracks, such as are made by otters, led to it. Whenever
the birds went to this spot they walked nearly erect in an awkward manner,
but when they sat in their nest they laid themselves flat on the eggs,
in the manner of a Goose or Duck. In no instance did they alight on the
islands, but always on the water, at some distance, when, after examining
all around them for a while, they crawled silently out, and moved to the
spot which contained their treasure.
</p>

<p>
Having been told that the Red-throated Diver covers its eggs with
down in the manner of many ducks, I was surprised to find the assertion
incorrect, and having killed several individuals during the period of incubation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
and immediately after it, I carefully examined them, and found
all of them fully covered with down, they being, in this respect, quite
different from the Eider Duck, the Velvet Duck, the Harlequin Duck,
and other species of that family, nay even from the Black Guillemot, of
which I shall speak in the present volume. Probably it is on account of
those birds breeding much farther north, that, according to Dr Richardson,
they there line their nest with down. We also found the <i>Colymbus glacialis</i>
incubating without any in its nest. The idea generally entertained
that this species never lays more than two eggs I found equally incorrect,
for of five nests, two contained two eggs each, two had three each, and
the fifth had three young birds. The eggs measure 3 inches in length
by
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> in breadth, and are of an elongated elliptical form, nearly equally
rounded at both ends; they are of a deep olive-brown colour, irregularly
marked with spots of a darker dull brown. The male incubates as well
as the female, and both are extremely solicitous about the safety of their
young, which betake themselves to the water on the day succeeding that
of their escape from the egg, and are from the first most expert swimmers
and divers. Two of the young were shot by Captain <span class="smcap">Emery</span>, having
been easily approached in the absence of their parents, at which he had
shot without success, they not having yet learned from experience the danger
of the proximity of man. They dived beautifully, and swam with
great buoyancy, inclining their necks forwards, in the manner of the old
birds. This was on the 5th July 1833. On the 15th of the same month,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Lincoln</span> and my son <span class="smcap">John Woodhouse</span>, saw several young
ones, which, although quite small, were equally expert at diving. When
swimming by the side of their mother they floated high, with the neck
quite erect, while the old bird swam deep, with her neck inclined forward.
When the little ones dived, they moved under the water like so many
turtles, and at last were caught on the bottom of the pond, which was
small and shallow, by placing the gun-rods upon them. So averse from
moving are the old birds when sitting on their eggs, that they will not
bestir themselves until in imminent danger, on which, however, they
scramble to the water, dive, and, on emerging, immediately rise on wing
without uttering any note. The male only is noisy on such occasions,
and more especially when it returns from afar to its mate, when it evinces
its satisfaction by calling aloud, as it repeatedly passes and repasses over
the spot, and then alights in a pompous manner on the water.
</p>

<p>
The sexes differ materially in size, the male birds being much larger
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
than the females, and weighing at an average fully a pound more. These
birds are extremely tenacious of life. One which my son shot on the
wing fell, dived instantly, and swam to a considerable distance under
water, but returned to the surface, back downwards, and quite dead.
</p>

<p>
The notes of the Red-throated Diver are harsh and rather loud; they
resemble the syllables <i>cac, cac, cac, carah, carah</i>, enounced in rapid succession.
In some instances the young men of my party found that the most
successful method of approaching these birds whilst on the water, was to
run as fast as possible towards them and shout loudly, for on such occasions
the birds dived instead of flying at once, and on emerging again, afforded
them much better chances as they took to wing. At certain times,
when approached while they have young, they utter a soft plaintive note,
which evidently conveys to their offspring their wish that they should remain
quiet in their hiding-places.
</p>

<p>
The Red-throated Diver does not acquire the full beauty of its plumage
until its fourth year. The young are at first covered with thick
hairy down, of a blackish colour, inclining to brown. Before they are
fully able to fly, this is changed into a dull grey on the upper parts, thickly
sprinkled with white dots on the extremity of each feather, the lower
parts being of a sullied white. During the second year these tints are
firmer, there are fewer spots above, and the texture of the lower parts is
more silky. In the third, both sexes assume the fine grey of the hind-neck,
with its longitudinal white stripes, and here and there a few spots
of red on the lower part of the throat. The next spring their plumage is
perfect.
</p>

<p>
I have never observed any of these birds on our inland lakes or rivers.
In the neighbourhood of Boston, and along the Bay of Fundy, they are
best known by the names of “Scape-grace” and “Cape-racer.” By the
9th of August the young birds had left the fresh-water lakes and ponds
for the bays on the coast, and we were informed by the settlers, both in
Newfoundland and Labrador, that, by the last days of September, none
were to be found in those countries.
</p>

<p>
The dislike which this species shews to fresh-water after the breeding-season
is such, that they are rarely seen in the upper part of large bays,
but prefer for their winter residence the shores of sea-islands and barren
rocks. Thus, at that season, they are met with about the outer islands of
the Bay of Fundy, and those along our eastern coast.
</p>

<p>
While in fresh water, the Red-throated Diver feeds principally on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
small fish, shrimps, leeches, snails, and aquatic insects. The masses of
feather-like substances often found in the stomachs of Grebes, I have
never met with in this species. Its flesh is oily, tough, dark-coloured, and
disagreeable to the taste, although I saw some Mountain Indians feeding
upon it at Labrador with apparent pleasure.

<h2>
THE GREAT RED-BREASTED RAIL, OR FRESHWATER
MARSH-HEN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Rallus elegans.</i></span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCIII. Male and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
No doubt exists in my mind that Wilson considered this beautiful
bird as merely the adult of <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, the manners of which he described,
as studied at Great Egg Harbour in New Jersey, while he gave
in his works the figure and colouring of the present species. My friend
<span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> has done the same, without, I apprehend, having seen
the two birds together. Always unwilling to find faults in so ardent a student
of nature as <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, I felt almost mortified when, after having, in
the company of my worthy and learned friend, the Reverend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>,
carefully examined the habits of both species, which, in form and
general appearance, are closely allied, I discovered the error which he had
in this instance committed. Independently of the great difference as to
size between the two species, there are circumstances connected with their
habits which mark them as distinct. The <i>Rallus elegans</i> is altogether a
fresh-water bird, while the <i>R. crepitans</i> never removes from the salt-water
marshes, that are met with along our eastern Atlantic coasts, from the
Jerseys to the Gulf of Mexico. Nay, the present species is found at considerable
distances inland, where it breeds and spends the whole year;
whereas the latter never goes farther from its maritime haunts than the
borders of the salt-marshes, and this merely on certain occasions, when
driven thither by the high risings of tides. The Fresh-water Marsh-hen,
besides, is confined to the Southern States, a few stragglers only having
been observed farther eastward than the State of Pennsylvania, and these
only in fresh-water meadows.
</p>

<p>
So long ago as the year 1810, on the 29th May, I caught one of these
birds, a female, at Henderson, in the State of Kentucky, when I made
the following memorandum respecting it:—“It is an excessively shy bird,
runs with great celerity, and when caught, cries like a common fowl.”
It weighed eleven ounces avoirdupois; its total length was
<span class="mixfract">20&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches,
and its alar extent 22.
</p>

<p>
This species constantly resides in the fresh-water marshes and ponds
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
in the interior of South Carolina, Georgia, the Floridas, and Louisiana,
from which a few migrate, and probably breed as far to the eastward as the
wet meadows of the Delaware and Schuylkil rivers, in the vicinity of which
I killed one female in New Jersey, a few miles from Camden, in July 1832,
in company with my friends <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span> and Mr <span class="smcap">Ogden</span>, of that
city. On inquiring of numerous hunters, I was told by several of them
that they now and then obtained a few of these birds, which they considered
as very rare, and knew only by the name of “King Rails.” On
recently examining the museums of our eastern cities my friend <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span> saw only one specimen; and Mr <span class="smcap">William Cooper</span> of New York
assured him that he had never seen any other individuals than those sent
to him from Charleston. Mr <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> was present at the killing of a
specimen near Philadelphia, which was <i>considered</i> as a very old individual
of the <i>Rallus crepitans</i>. In Louisiana, the Creoles know this bird by the
name of <i>Grand Râle de Prairie</i>.
</p>

<p>
As the Fresh-water Marsh-Hen is abundant in South Carolina, I
shall attempt to describe its habits as observed in that State, both by myself
and by my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, of whose notes, delivered to me for
the purpose, I shall make free use. “Although not nearly so numerous
as the other species, they are not rare in that country, in certain favourable
situations. Wherever there are extensive marshes by the sides of
sluggish streams, where the bellowings of the alligator are heard at intervals,
and the pipings of myriads of frogs fill the air, there is found the
Fresh-water Marsh-hen, and there it may be seen gliding swiftly among
the tangled rank grasses and aquatic weeds, or standing on the broad
leaves of the yellow Cyamus and fragrant Water-lily, or forcing its way
through the dense foliage of Pontederiæ; and Sagittariæ. There, during
the sickly season, it remains secure from the search of man, and there, on
some hillock or little island of the marsh, it builds its nest. In such
places I have found so many as twenty pairs breeding within a space having
a diameter of thirty yards. The nests were placed <i>on the ground</i>,
and raised to the height of six or eight inches by means of withered weeds
and grasses. The number of eggs was nine or ten. About the middle
of March I found a few nests containing two or three eggs each; but, in
my opinion, the greater number of these birds commence breeding about
the middle of April. They appear to repair their nests from time to time,
and to return to them several years in succession.”
</p>

<p>
The young, which are at first black, leave the nest as soon as they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
burst the shell, and follow their mother, who leads them along the borders
of the streams and pools, where they find abundance of food, consisting
of grass-seeds, insects, tadpoles, leeches, and small crayfish. At
this early period, when running among the grass, which they do with
great activity, they may easily be mistaken for meadow-mice. My friend
<span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, who had several times attempted to raise these birds, with the
view of domesticating them, did not succeed, principally, he thinks, on
account of the difficulty of procuring enough of their accustomed food.
They all died in a few days, although the greatest attention was paid to
them.
</p>

<p>
When grown they feed on a variety of substances, and it has appeared
to me that they eat a much greater proportion of seeds and other vegetable
matters than the Salt-water Marsh-Hens. It is true, however,
that, in the gizzard of the latter we find portions of the <i>Spartina glabra</i>;
but when that kind of food is not to be procured, which is the case during
three-fourths of the year, they feed principally on “Fiddlers,” small
fish, and mollusca. In the gizzard of the present species, besides the food
already mentioned, I have always found a much greater quantity of the
seeds of such grasses as grow in the places frequented by them. On one
occasion I found the gizzard crammed with seeds of the cane (<i>Arundo
tecta</i>); and that of another contained a large quantity of the seed of the
common oat, which had evidently been picked up on a newly sown field
adjoining to the marsh. In autumn I have killed this species in cornfields,
in the company of <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, <span class="smcap">Paul H. Lees</span>, Esq. and
others. These birds are rarely shot by common gunners, on account of
the difficulty of raising them, and because they generally confine themselves
to places so swampy and covered with briars, smilaxes, and rough
weeds, that they are scarcely accessible. But although they are thus
safe from man, they are not without numerous enemies.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> once killed a large Moccasin snake, on opening
which he found an old bird of this species, that had evidently been swallowed
but a short time before. Its feathers are frequently found lying on
the banks of rice-fields, ponds, and lagoons, in places where the tracks of
the minx plainly disclose the plunderer. The Barred Owl and the Great
Horned Owl also occasionally succeed in capturing them in the dusk.
“On one occasion,” says my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, in a note addressed to me,
“while placed on a stand for deer, I saw a wild cat creeping through a
marsh that was near to me, evidently following by stealthy steps something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
that he was desirous of making his prey. Presently he made a sudden
pounce into a bunch of grass, when I immediately heard the piercing
cries of the Marsh-Hen, and shortly after came passing by me the successful
murderer with the bird in his mouth.”
</p>

<p>
“In seasons of great drought, when the marshes which are their favourite
haunts become dry, these birds have been known entirely to disappear
from the neighbourhood, and not to return until after heavy rains,
having in the mean time, no doubt, retired to the shores of the larger and
deeper ponds of the swamps of the interior.”
</p>

<p>
The young of this species acquire the redness of their plumage during
the first summer, and increase in size and beauty for several years,
without experiencing any change in their colouring after the spring following
that of their birth. The sexes are scarcely distinguishable otherwise
than by the difference of size, the males being considerably larger
than the females. I am not aware that this species raises more than one
brood in the season, although, when its eggs have been destroyed, it may
lay a second time.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this Rail resembles that of the salt-water kind, but
is considerably stronger and more protracted. When suddenly flushed,
they rise and go off with a chuck, their legs dangling beneath, and generally
proceed in a straight line for some distance, after which they drop
among the thickest grass, and run off with surprising speed. In several
instances they have been known to stand before a careful pointer. They
are less apt to take to the water than the <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, and are by no
means so expert at diving. Their number does not appear to be diminished
in winter by any migratory movements. Their cries, which do
not differ much from those of the other species, are less frequently repeated
after the breeding season.
</p>

<p>
Few birds afford better food than this species: during autumn, when,
feeding chiefly on grass seeds, they are juicy and tender; in spring, however,
they are less delicate. Their superiority in size over all other birds
of the genus that occur in the United States, renders them valuable game
to the knowing sportsman and epicure. Their eggs also are excellent as
food, being much preferable to those of the common fowl.
</p>

<p>
I regret that I am obliged to conclude this account, without being
able to describe the eggs, which, although well known to my friend <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span>, have not yet come under my inspection, but which I trust I
shall have an opportunity of figuring in the concluding plates of my work.

Although this species is a constant resident, and extremely abundant
along the salt marshes and reedy sea islands of South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana, to the mouths of the Mississippi, and
probably farther south, at all seasons of the year, it leaves these districts
in considerable numbers in spring, and extends its movements along the
Atlantic shores as far as the Middle States. They confine themselves entirely
to the salt-marshes in the immediate vicinity of the Atlantic, the
islands and the channels between them and the main shores, but are never
seen inland or on fresh waters, unless when, during high tides, they remove
to the margins of the main, where, indeed, during heavy gales and high
seas, these poor birds are forced to take refuge, in order to escape the destructive
fury of the tempest that, notwithstanding their utmost exertions,
destroys great numbers of them. On all such occasions the birds appear
greatly intimidated and stupified, and as if out of their proper element.
Those individuals which leave the south for a season, reach the shores of
New Jersey about the middle of April, and return to the southern States
about the beginning of October, to spend the winter along with their
young, after which period none are to be found in the Middle Districts.
Few if any ever go beyond Long Island in the State of New York; at least
I have never seen or heard of one farther east. Their migrations take place
under night, and in perfect silence; but the moment they arrive at their
destination, they announce their presence by a continuation of loud cacklings,
meant no doubt as an expression of their joy. Having studied the
habits of these interesting birds in the Jerseys, in South Carolina, and in
the Floridas, on the maritime borders of all of which they breed, I shall
here attempt to describe them.
</p>

<p>
In these countries, from about the beginning of March to that of
April, the salt-marshes resound with the cries of the Clapper Rail, which
resemble the syllables <i>cac, cac, cac, cac, cā, cāhā, cāhā</i>. The commencement
of the cry, which is heard quite as frequently during day as by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
night, is extremely loud and rapid, its termination lower and protracted.
At the report of a gun, when thousands of these birds instantaneously
burst forth with their cries, you may imagine what an uproar they make.
This bird seems to possess the power of ventriloquism, for, when several
hundred yards off, its voice often seems to be issuing from the grass
around you. At this period, the males are very pugnacious, and combats
are rife until each has selected a female for the season. The males stand
erect and cry aloud the least sound they hear, guard their mates, and
continue faithfully to protect them until the young make their appearance.
These come more under the care of the mother, who leads them
about until they have attained a considerable size, and are able to shift
for themselves. The nest is large, constructed of marsh plants, and fastened
to the stems in the midst of the thickest tufts, above high-water
mark. The materials of which it is formed are so well interlaced with
the plants around them, as to prevent their being washed away by extraordinarily
high tides, which, however, sometimes carry off and destroy
the eggs, as well as many of the sitting birds, whose attachment to them
is so great, that they are now and then drowned while endeavouring to
keep them safe. The nest is very deep, so that the eggs seem placed in
the bottom of a bowl or funnel. They are from eight to fifteen in number,
measure an inch and a half in length by one and an eighth in breadth,
and have a pale buff colour, sparingly sprinkled with light umber and
purplish spots. The period of incubation is fourteen days. When undisturbed,
this species lays only one set of eggs in the season; but as the
eggs are in request as a delicious article of food, they are gathered in
great numbers, and I myself have collected so many as seventy-two
dozens in the course of a day. The nest is generally open at top, and
then is very easily discovered, although sometimes the reeds are so arranged
about them as to conceal them from the view. When the birds are sitting,
they suffer you to approach within a few feet; but, as if aware of
your intention, they glide away in silence to some distance, and remain
crouched among the grass until you have retired. When, on returning,
the poor bird finds that her treasure has been stolen, she immediately
proclaims her grief aloud, and in this is joined by her faithful mate. In
a few days, however, more eggs are deposited, although, I believe, never
in the same nest. This species may be called gregarious, yet the nests
are seldom nearer to each other than five or ten yards. They are placed
in the thickest and most elevated tufts of grass, principally near the edges
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
of the many lagoons that everywhere intersect the sea marshes, so that a
man may go from one to another, finding them with ease as he proceeds
along the muddy shores. In the Jerseys, it forms almost a regular occupation
to collect the eggs of this bird, and there I have seen twenty or
more persons gathering them by thousands during the season; in fact, it
is not an uncommon occurrence for an egger to carry home a hundred
dozens in a day; and when this havock is continued upwards of a month,
you may imagine its extent. The abundance of the birds themselves is
almost beyond belief; but if you suppose a series of salt marshes twenty
miles in length, and a mile in breadth, while at every eight or ten steps
one or two birds may be met with, you may calculate their probable
number.
</p>

<p>
During ebb, the Clapper Rail advances towards the edge of the waters
as they recede, and searches, either among the grasses, or along the
deep furrows made by the ebb and flow of the tides, for its food, which
consists principally of small crabs, a species of salt-water snail attached
to the rushes, the fry of fishes, aquatic insects, and plants. When the
tide flows, they gradually return, and at high-water they resort to the
banks, where they remain concealed until the waters begin to retreat.
This species is by no means exclusively nocturnal, for it moves about in
search of food during the whole of the day, in this respect resembling the
Gallinules. Their courage is now and then brought to the test by the
sudden approach of some of their winged enemies, such as a Hawk or an
Owl, especially the Marsh Hawk, which is often attacked by them while
sailing low over the grass in which they are commonly concealed. On
such occasions, the Rail rises a few yards in the air, strikes at the marauder
with bill and claws, screaming aloud all the while, and dives again
among the grass, to the astonishment of the bird of prey, which usually
moves off at full speed. They are not so fortunate in their encounters
with such hawks as pounce from on high on their prey, such as the Red-tailed
and Red-shouldered Hawks, against which they have no chance of
defending themselves. Minxes, racoons, and wild cats destroy a great
number of them during night, and many are devoured by turtles and ravenous
fishes; but their worst enemy is man. My friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> has
shot so many as sixty in the course of four hours, and others have killed
double that number in double the time.
</p>

<p>
The Salt-water Marsh Hen swims with considerable ease, though not
swiftly or gracefully. While in this act, it extends its neck forward, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
strikes the water with its feet, as if unwilling to move far at a time, the
motion of its neck resembling that of the Gallinules. It dives well, remains
a considerable time under water, and in this manner dexterously
eludes its pursuers, although it certainly does not possess the power of
holding fast to the bottom, as some persons have alleged. When hard
pressed, it often sinks just below the surface, keeping the bill above in
order to breathe, and in this position, if not detected, remains for a considerable
time. If perceived and approached, it instantly dives, and uses
its wings to accelerate its progress, but rises as soon as it comes to a place
of safety.
</p>

<p>
Their movements on the ground, or over the partially submersed or
floating beds of weeds, are extremely rapid, and they run swiftly off before
a dog, the utmost exertions of which are required to force them on
wing. Such an attempt by man would prove utterly futile, unless he
were to come upon them unawares. When not pursued, and feeling secure,
they walk in a deliberate manner, the body considerably inclined,
now and then jerking the tail upwards, although by no means so frequently
as Gallinules are wont to do. On the least appearance of danger,
they lower the head, stretch out the neck, and move off with incomparable
speed, always in perfect silence. They have thousands of paths
among the rank herbage, crossing each other so often that they can very
easily escape pursuit; and besides, they have a power of compressing
their body to such a degree, as frequently to force a passage between two
stems so close, that one could hardly believe it possible for them to squeeze
themselves through. When put up, they fly slowly and generally straight
before you, with their legs dangling, so that they are very easily shot by
a quick sportsman, as they rarely fly far at a time on such occasions, but
prefer pitching down again into the first tuft of rank grass in their way.
When on their migrations, however, they pass low and swiftly over the
marshes, or the water, stretched to their full extent, and with a constant
beat of the wings.
</p>

<p>
The young, which are at first covered with down of a black colour,
obtain their full plumage before the winter arrives, and after this undergo
little change of colour, although they increase in size for a year after.
In the Eastern States, this species is not held in much estimation as an
article of food, perhaps in a great measure on account of the quantity of
Soras met with there during early autumn, and which are certainly more
delicate; but in the Southern States, especially during winter, they are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
considered good for the table, and a great number are killed and offered
for sale in the markets. Numbers are destroyed by torch light, which so
dazzles their eyes, as to enable persons fond of the sport to knock them
down with poles or paddles during high tides. It is by day, however,
that they are usually shot, and as this kind of sport is exceedingly pleasant,
I will attempt to describe it.
</p>

<p>
About Charleston, in South Carolina, the shooting of Marsh Hens
takes place from September to February, a few days in each month during
the spring-tides. A light skiff or canoe is procured, the latter being
much preferable, and paddled by one or two experienced persons, the
sportsman standing in the bow, and his friend, if he has one with him,
taking his station in the stern. At an early hour they proceed to the
marshes, amid many boats containing parties on the same errand. There
is no lack of shooting-grounds, for every creek of salt-water swarms with
Marsh Hens. The sportsman who leads has already discharged his barrels,
and on either side of his canoe a bird has fallen. As the boat moves
swiftly towards them, more are raised, and although he may not be ready,
the safety of the bird is in imminent jeopardy, for now from another bark
double reports are heard in succession. The tide is advancing apace, the
boats merely float along, and the birds, driven from place to place, seek
in vain for safety. Here, on a floating mass of tangled weeds, stand a
small group side by side. The gunner has marked them, and presently
nearly the whole covey is prostrated. Now, onward to that great bunch
of tall grass all the boats are seen to steer; shot after shot flies in rapid
succession; dead and dying lie all around on the water; the terrified survivors
are trying to save their lives by hurried flight; but their efforts are
unavailing,—one by one they fall, to rise no more. It is a sorrowful
sight, after all: see that poor thing gasping hard in the agonies of death,
its legs quivering with convulsive twitches, its bright eyes fading into
glazed obscurity. In a few hours, hundreds have ceased to breathe the
breath of life; hundreds that erst revelled in the joys of careless existence,
but which can never behold their beloved marshes again. The cruel
sportsman, covered with mud and mire, drenched to the skin by the
splashing of the paddles, his face and hands besmeared with powder,
stands amid the wreck which he has made, exultingly surveys his
slaughtered heaps, and with joyous feelings returns home with a cargo of
game more than enough for a family thrice as numerous as his own. How
joyful must be the congratulations of those which have escaped, without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
injury to themselves or their relatives! With what pleasure, perhaps,
have some of them observed the gun of one of their murderers, or the powder-flask
of another, fall overboard! How delighted have they been to see a
canoe overturned by an awkward movement, and their enemies struggling
to reach the shore, or sticking fast in the mud! Nor have the minx and
racoon come off well, for notwithstanding the expertness of the former
at diving, and the cunning of the latter, many have been shot, and the
boatmen intend to make caps of their fur.
</p>

<p>
In the Carolinas there are some most expert marksmen, of whom I
know two who probably were never surpassed. One of them I have seen
shoot fifty Marsh-Hens at fifty successive shots, and the other, I am assured,
has killed a hundred without missing one. I have heard or read of
a French king, who, on starting a partridge, could take a pinch of snuff,
then point his gun, and shoot the bird; but whether this be true or not
I cannot say, although I have witnessed as remarkable a feat, for I have
seen a Carolinian, furnished with two guns, shoot at and kill four Marsh-Hens
as they flew off at once around him! On speaking once to a friend
of the cruelty of destroying so many of these birds, he answered me as
follows:—“It gives variety to life; it is good exercise, and in all cases
affords a capital dinner, besides the pleasure I feel when sending a mess
of Marsh-Hens to a friend such as you.”

<h2>
THE VIRGINIAN RAIL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Rallus virginianus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCV. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
This species, which, although smaller, bears a great resemblance to
the Great Red-breasted Rail or Fresh-water Marsh-Hen, is met with in
most parts of the United States at different seasons. Many spend the
winter within our southern limits, and I have found them at that time
in Lower Louisiana, the Floridas, Georgia, and the Carolinas. In the
Western country some have been known to remain until severe frost came
on, and there they usually stay to a much later period than in our Middle
Districts, from which they generally retire southward in the beginning of
October. During spring and summer, I observed some in different places
from the shores of the Wabash River in Illinois, to those of the St John’s
in the British province of New Brunswick. In the latter district, they
were considered extremely rare birds by the inhabitants, some of whom
brought me a few as great curiosities. Farther north, I neither saw nor
heard of any; but on the borders of Lakes Erie and Michigan, they
breed in considerable numbers, as well as near our maritime districts.
</p>

<p>
In its habits the <i>Rallus virginianus</i> is intermediate between the <i>R.
crepitans</i> and <i>R. carolinus</i>: it obtains its food as well <i>in salt-water marshes</i>,
as in fresh meadows, watery savannahs, and the borders of ponds and
rivers. The latter situations, however, seem to suit it best during summer;
but whenever both kinds of places are combined, or near each other, there
you are sure to meet with it.
</p>

<p>
The time of breeding varies according to the latitude of the place. I
have found the female sitting on her eggs in the beginning of March, a
few miles from New Orleans; in that of April in Kentucky, near Henderson;
about a fortnight later near Vincennes, in Illinois; and from the
10th of May to the middle of June, in the Middle and Eastern States.
The males usually arrive at the breeding-places a week or ten days before
the females. They travel silently and by night, as I have ascertained
by observing them proceed singly and in a direct course, at a height
of only a few feet, over our broad rivers, or over level land, when their
speed is such as is never manifested by them under ordinary circumstances.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
Their movements can be easily traced for fifty yards or so during
nights of brilliant moonshine, when you see them passing with a constant
beat of the wings, in the manner of a Green-winged Teal. As soon
as they arrive at their destination, they may be heard emitting their cries
about sunset, occasionally through the night, and again with increased
vigour at the dawn of day, as if expressing their impatience for the arrival
of their companions. The love-notes of this species have some resemblance
to those of the Clapper Rail, but now and then are changed
for others something like <i>crek, crek, creek</i>, or <i>creek, creek, creek</i>. Being
expert ventriloquists, like their congeners, they sometimes seem to be far
off, when in fact they are within a few yards of you. One morning I had
the good fortune to witness their amatory gestures, which I will here try
to describe, that you may in some degree participate in the amusement
which the scene afforded me.
</p>

<p>
The sun had scarcely begun to send his horizontal rays over the lake,
on the margin of which I stood, revolving in my mind the many enjoyments
which the Author of nature has benignantly accorded to his creatures.
The air was clear and serene, and the waters spread before me
without a ruffle on their surface. The notes of the Rail came loudly on
my ear, and on moving towards the spot whence they proceeded, I observed
the bird exhibiting the full ardour of his passion. Now with open
wings raised over its body, it ran around its beloved, opening and flirting
its tail with singular speed. Each time it passed before her, it would pause
for a moment, raise itself to the full stretch of its body and legs, and bow
to her with all the grace of a well-bred suitor of our own species. The female
also bowed in recognition, and at last, as the male came nearer and
nearer in his circuits, yielded to his wishes, on which the pair flew off in
the manner of house-pigeons, sailing and balancing their bodies on open
wings until out of sight. During this exhibition, the male emitted a mellow
note, resembling the syllables <i>cuckoe, cuckoe</i>, to which the female responded
with the kind of lisping sound uttered by young birds of the
species when newly hatched.
</p>

<p>
Excepting our Little Partridge, I know no bird so swift of foot as
the Virginian Rail. In fact, I doubt if it would be an easy matter for an
active man to outstrip one of them on plain ground; and to trust to one’s
speed for raising one among the thick herbage to which they usually
resort, would certainly prove fallacious. There they run to a short distance,
then tack about, and again scud away in a lateral direction, so as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
to elude the best dog, or if likely to be overtaken, rise on wing, fly with
dangling legs eight or ten yards, drop among the weeds, and run off as
swiftly as before. Notwithstanding all this, I managed to secure a good
number of them by means of a partridge net, setting the wings of that
apparatus at very obtuse angles, and calling them by imitating the lisping
notes of the female from some distance beyond the bag of the net.
Now and then I found them too cunning for me, as, on discovering that
the wings of the net were in their way, they would get over it in the
same manner as that in which a sailor mounts the shrouds of a ship. Our
Common Coot uses the same artifice, as I shall elsewhere describe.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Virginian Rail is not easily found after incubation
has commenced, for then the male, contrary to the habits of most birds,
becomes comparatively silent, and the female quite mute. At such times
I have once or twice almost trodden on one, which I should never have
discovered, had not the poor bird fluttered off in despair, employing all
the artifices used by other species on such occasions. It is placed on a
small elevation formed by the accumulation of the stalks of a large bunch
of grasses, in the centre of which some dry weeds are arranged to the
height of two or three inches, with a very shallow cavity. The eggs are
four or five, seldom more than six or seven, and resemble in colour those
of the <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, although smaller, measuring an inch and a quarter
in length, by eleven-twelfths in breadth, and being rather more rounded.
The young are covered with a jet black down, and run after their mother
as soon as they make their escape from the egg;—at least I suppose this
to be the case, on account of my having caught some that seemed newly
hatched. The mother leads them with the greatest care among the
long grass of the damp meadows, or the weeds growing near the ponds, to
which they resort at all times, and particularly near the margins of pools
or muddy streams, into which they run and disperse on the least appearance
of danger. When no water is near, the little ones squat in silence,
and await the call of their parent, to which all at once answer, when they
quickly collect once more around her.
</p>

<p>
This species is able to cling to, and climb along the blades of tall
grasses, even under water, when in danger, and is equally able to swim
gracefully to a considerable distance, as to alight on low bushes, in which
situation I have shot a few of them. When amid the broad leaves of
water-lilies, they walk and run on them with as much ease as the Gallinules;
and I would be inclined to assign them an intermediate station
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
between the genera Rallus and Crex, as they partake of the habits of
both. When pursued, the Virginian Rail is, with great difficulty, put
up, as I have already mentioned, but when it is once on wing it may be
shot by a very ordinary gunner. It rises without noise, flies off with its
legs dangling and its neck stretched out, but seldom proceeds farther
than twenty or thirty yards at a time, unless when it has a stream to
cross, or during its migrations. Like all the other species with which I
am acquainted, it feeds both by day and by night. Its food consists of
small slugs, snails, aquatic insects, worms, crustacea, and the seeds of
those grasses which grow in salt or fresh water marshes, in either of which
they reside and even breed. I have not been able to ascertain whether
they lay more than once in the season; but, on account of the comparatively
small number of this species, I am inclined to suppose that they
seldom raise more than one brood, unless their eggs have been destroyed,
whether by inundation or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
The Virginian Rail is not without enemies; and, although it manifests
a good deal of courage, and at times acts towards the Marsh Hawk
in the same manner as the <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, it seldom succeeds in its attempts,
and on several occasions I have seen that bird seize them as they
attempted to strike it with their bill and claws for the purpose of driving
it away. The minx, the garfish, the snapping turtle, and sometimes eels,
destroy them, as well as the Sora Rail.
</p>

<p>
Whilst at Charleston in South Carolina, I frequently saw little strings
of these birds exposed in the market, at a very low price; and they are
excellent eating during autumn and winter. Their comparative scarcity,
however, prevents the gunner from searching after them with the same
eagerness as he pursues the <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, and to shoot a dozen in the
course of a day may be considered a remarkable feat. In that country,
during the latter part of autumn, and in winter, they are usually met with
in the salt-marshes bordering the estuaries of large rivers.
</p>

<p>
Like the two preceding species, the Virginian Rail has the power of
contracting its body to enable it to pass with more ease between the stalks
of strong grasses or other plants. When observed unseen, it frequently
jerks the tail upwards, in the manner of Gallinules, but the moment it
notices any one of its enemies, it droops the tail, lowers its head, and runs
off with the quickness of thought.
</p>

<p>
The young of this species are at first of a black colour, like that of
<i>Rallus crepitans</i> and <i>R. elegans</i>; but, like those of the latter, attain the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>
rufous hue of the parent birds before the commencement of winter, although
they increase in size and improve in the depth of their tints probably
for several years.

In colouring this species is so nearly allied to <i>R. elegans</i>, that the description

<h2>
THE AMERICAN SUN PERCH.
</h2>

<p>
Few of our smaller fresh-water fishes excel either in beauty or in delicacy
and flavour the species which I have chosen as the subject of this
article, and few afford more pleasure to young fishers. Although it occurs in
all our streams, whether rapid or gentle, small or large, in the mill-dam overshadowed
by tall forest-trees, or in the open lake margined with reeds,
you must never expect to find it in impure waters. Let the place be
deep or shallow, broad or narrow, the water must be clear enough to
allow the sun’s rays to fall unimpaired on the rich coat of mail that covers
the body of the Sun-fish. Look at him as he poises himself under the
lee of the protecting rock beneath our feet! See how steadily he maintains
his position, and yet how many rapid motions of his fins are necessary
to preserve it! Now another is by his side, glowing with equal
beauty, and poising itself by equally easy and graceful movements. The
sun is shining, and under the lee of every stone and sunk log, some of the
little creatures are rising to the surface, to enjoy the bright blaze, which
enhances all their beauty. The golden hues of some parts of the body
blend with the green of the emerald, while the coral tints of the lower
parts and the red of its sparkling eye, render our little favourite a perfect
gem of the waters.
</p>

<p>
The rushing stream boils and gurgles as it forces its way over the
obstacles presented by its bed, the craggy points, large stones, and logs
that are strewn along the bottom. Every one of these proves a place
of rest, safety and observation to the little things, whose eyes are ever
anxiously watching their favourite prey as it passes. There an unfortunate
moth, swept along by the current, labours in vain to extricate itself
from the treacherous element; its body, indeed, at intervals, rises a little
above the surface, but its broad wings, now wet and heavy, bear it down
again to the water. The Sun-fish has marked it, and as it passes his retreat,
he darts towards it, with twenty of his fellows, all eager to seize
the prize. The swiftest swallows it in a moment, and all immediately
return to their lurking places, where they fancy themselves secure. But,
alas, the Sun-fish is no more without enemies than the moth, or any other
living creature. So has Nature determined, evidently to promote prudence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
and industry, without which none can reap the full advantage of
life.
</p>

<p>
On the top of yon miller’s dam stands boldly erect the ardent fisher.
Up to the knees, and regardless of the danger of his situation, he prepares
his apparatus of destruction. A keen hook attached to his grass-line is
now hid within the body of a worm or grasshopper. With a knowing
eye he marks one after another every surge of the water below. Observing
the top of a rock scarcely covered, he sends his hook towards it with
gentleness and certainty; the bait now floats and anon sinks; his reel
slowly lengthens the line, which is suddenly tightened, and he feels that
a fish is secured. Now whirls the reel again, thrice has the fish tried its
utmost strength and speed, but, soon panting and exhausted, it is seen
floating for a moment on the surface. Nothing now is required but to
bring it to hand, which done, the angler baits anew, and sends forth the
treacherous morsel. For an hour or more he continues the agreeable occupation,
drawing from the stream a fish at every short interval. To the
willow-twig fastened to his waist, a hundred “sunnies” are already attached.
Suddenly the sky is overcast, and the crafty fisher, although
aware that, with a different hook and bait, he might soon procure a fine
eel or two, carefully wades to the shore, and homeward leisurely plods
his way.
</p>

<p>
In this manner are the sun-fishes caught by the regular or “scientific”
anglers, and a beautiful sight it is to see the ease and grace with which
they allure the objects of their desire, whether in the open turbulence of
the waters, or under the low boughs of the overhanging trees, where, in
some deep hole, a swarm of the little creatures may be playing in fancied
security. Rarely does his tackle become entangled, whilst, with incomparable
dexterity, he draws one after another from the waters.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of individuals, however, there are, who, less curious in
their mode of fishing, often procure as many sunnies without allowing
them to play for a moment. Look at these boys! One stands on the
shore, while the others are on fallen trees that project over the stream.
Their rods, as you perceive, are merely shoots of the hazel or hickory,
their lines are simply twine, and their hooks none of the finest. One has
a calabash filled with worms and grubs of many sorts, kept alive in damp
earth, and another is supplied with a bottle containing half a gross of live
“hoppers;” the third has no bait at all, but borrows from his nearest
neighbour. Well, there they are, “three merry boys,” whirling their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
rods in the air to unrol their lines, on one of which, you observe, a cork
is fastened, while on another is a bit of light wood, and on the third a
grain or two of large shot, to draw it at once to a certain depth. Now
their hooks are baited, and all are ready. Each casts his line as he thinks
best, after he has probed the depth of the stream with his rod, to enable
him to place his buoy at the proper point. Bob, bob, goes the cork;
down it moves; the bit of wood disappears; the leaded line tightens; in
a moment up swing the sunnies, which, getting unhooked, are projected
far among the grass, where they struggle in vain, until death ends their
efforts. The hooks are now baited anew, and dropped into the water.
The fish is abundant, the weather propitious and delightful, for it is now
October, and so greedy have the sunnies become of grasshoppers and grubs,
that dozens at once dash at the same bait. The lads, believe me, have
now rare sport, and in an hour scarcely a fish remains in the hole. The
happy children have caught perhaps some hundreds of delicious “pan-fish,”
to feed their parents, and delight their little sisters. Surely their
pleasure is fully as great as that experienced by the scientific angler.
</p>

<p>
I have known instances when the waters of a dam having been let out,
for some reason better known to the miller than to myself, all the sun-fish
have betaken themselves to one or two deep holes, as if to avoid being
carried away from their favourite abode. There I have seen them in
such multitudes that one could catch as many as he pleased with a pinhook,
fastened to any sort of line, and baited with any sort of worm or
insect, or even with a piece of a newly caught fish. Yet, and I am not
able to account for it, all of a sudden, without apparent cause, they would
cease to take, and no allurement whatever could entice them or the other
fishes in the pool to seize the hook.
</p>

<p>
During high freshets, this species of perch seldom bites at any thing,
but you may procure them with a cast-net or a seine, provided you are
well acquainted with the localities. On the contrary, when the waters
are low and clear, every secluded hole, every eddy under the lee of a
rock, every place sheltered by a raft of timber, will afford you amusement.
In some parts of the Southern States, the Negroes procure these
fishes late in the autumn in shallow ponds or bayous, by wading through
the water with caution, and placing at every few steps a wicker apparatus,
not unlike a small barrel, open at both ends. The moment the fishes
find themselves confined within the lower part of this, which is pressed to
the bottom of the stream, their skippings announce their capture, and the
fisher secures his booty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
</p>

<p>
This species, the <i>Labrus auritus</i> of Linnæus, the <i>Pomotis vulgaris</i>
of Cuvier, seldom exceeds five or six inches in length, but is rather
deep in proportion. The usual size is from four to five inches, with a
depth of from two to two and a half. They are not bony, and at all seasons
afford delicate eating. Having observed a considerable change in
their colour in different parts of the United States; and in different
streams, ponds, or lakes, I was led to think that this curious effect might
be produced by the difference of colour in the water. Thus, the Sun-fish
caught in the deep waters of Green River, in Kentucky, exhibit a depth
of olive-brown quite different from the general tint of those caught in the
colourless waters of the Ohio or Schuylkill; those of the reddish-coloured
waters of the Bayous of the Louisiana swamps, look as if covered with a
coppery tarnish; and, lastly, those met with in streams that glide beneath
cedars or other firs, have a pale and sallow complexion.
</p>

<p>
The Sun Perch, wherever found, seems to give a decided preference to
sandy, gravelly, or rocky beds of streams, avoiding those of which the
bottom is muddy. At the period of depositing their eggs, this preference
is still more apparent. The little creature is then seen swimming rapidly
over shallows, the bed of which is mostly formed of fine gravel, when after
a while it is observed to poise itself and gradually sink to the bottom,
where with its fin it pushes aside the sand to the extent of eight or ten
inches, thus forming a circular cavity. In a few days a little ridge is
thus raised around, and in the cleared area the roe is deposited. By wading
carefully over the extent of the place, a person may count forty, fifty,
or more of these beds, some within a few feet of each other, and some several
yards apart. Instead of abandoning its spawn, as others of the family
are wont to do, this little fish keeps guard over it with all the care
of a sitting bird. You observe it poised over the bed, watching the objects
around. Should the rotten leaf of a tree, a piece of wood, or any
other substance, happen to be rolled over the border of the bed, the Sun-fish
carefully removes it, holding the obnoxious matter in its mouth, and
dropping it over the margin. Having many times witnessed this act of
prudence and cleanliness in the little sunny, and observed that at this period
it will not seize on any kind of bait, I took it into my head one fair
afternoon to make a few experiments for the purpose of judging how far
its instinct or reason might induce it to act when disturbed or harassed.
</p>

<p>
Provided with a fine fishing-line, and such insects as I knew were relished
by this fish, I reached a sand-bar covered by about one foot of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
water, where I had previously seen many deposits. Approaching the
nearest to the shore with great care, I baited my hook with a living
ground-worm, the greater part of which was left at liberty to writhe as it
pleased, and throwing the line up the stream, managed it so that at last
it passed over the border of the nest, when I allowed it to remain on the
bottom. The fish, I perceived, had marked me, and as the worm intruded
on its premises, he swam to the farther side, there poised himself
for a few moments, then approached the worm, and carried it in his mouth
over the side next to me, with a care and gentleness so very remarkable
as to afford me much surprise. I repeated the experiment six or seven
times, and always with the same result. Then changing the bait, I employed
a young grasshopper, which I floated into the egg-bed. The insect
was removed, as the worm had been, and two attempts to hook the
fish proved unsuccessful. I now threw my line with the hook bare, and
managed as before. The sunny appeared quite alarmed. It swam to one
side, then to another, in rapid succession, and seemed to entertain a fear
that the removal of the suspicious object might prove extremely dangerous
to it. Yet it gradually approached the hook, took it delicately up,
and the next instant dropped it over the edge of the bed!
</p>

<p>
Reader, if you are one who, like me, have studied Nature with a desire
to improve your mental faculties, and contemplate the wonderful phenomena
that present themselves to the view at every step we take in her wide
domain, you would have been struck, had you witnessed the actions of
this little fish, as I was, with admiration of the Being who gave such instincts
to so humble an object. I gazed in amazement on the little creature,
and wondered that nature had endowed it with such feelings and
powers. The irrepressible desire of acquiring knowledge prompted me to
continue the experiment; but with whatever dexterity I could in those
days hook a fish, all my efforts proved abortive, not with this individual
only, but with many others, which I subjected to the same trials.
</p>

<p>
Satisfied that at this period the Sun-fish was more than a match for
me, I rolled up my line, and with the rod gave a rap on the water as
nearly over the fish as I could. The sunny darted off to a distance of
several yards, poised itself steadily, and as soon as my rod was raised
from the water, returned to its station. The effect of the blow on the
water was now apparent, for I perceived that the fish was busily employed
in smoothing the bed; but here ended my experiments on the
Sun-fish.

<p>
I have always experienced a peculiar pleasure while endeavouring to
study the habits of this most beautiful bird in its favourite places of resort.
Never on such occasions have I been without numberless companions,
who, although most of them were insensible of my presence, have
afforded me hours of the never-failing delight resulting from the contemplation
of their character. Methinks I am now seated by the trunk of a
gigantic sycamore, whose bleached branches stretch up towards the heavens,
as if with a desire to overlook the dense woods spread all around.
A dark-watered bayou winds tortuously beneath the maples that margin
its muddy shores, a deep thicket of canes spreading along its side. The
mysterious silence is scarcely broken by the hum of myriads of insects.
The blood-sucking musquito essays to alight on my hand, and I willingly
allow him to draw his fill, that I may observe how dexterously he
pierces my skin with his delicate proboscis, and pumps the red fluid into
his body, which is quickly filled, when with difficulty he extends his tiny
wings and flies off, never to return. Over the withered leaves many a
tick is seen scrambling, as if anxious to elude the searching eye of that
beautiful lizard. A squirrel spread flat against a tree, with its head directed
downwards, is watching me; the warblers, too, are peeping from
among the twigs. On the water, the large bull-frogs are endeavouring
to obtain a peep of the sun; suddenly there emerges the head of an otter,
with a fish in its jaws, and in an instant my faithful dog plunges after
him, but is speedily recalled. At this moment, when my heart is filled
with delight, the rustling of wings comes sweeping through the woods,
and anon there shoots overhead a flock of Wood Ducks. Once, twice,
three times, have they rapidly swept over the stream, and now, having
failed to discover any object of alarm, they all alight on its bosom, and
sound a note of invitation to others yet distant.
</p>

<p>
Scenes like these I have enjoyed a thousand times, yet regret that
I have not enjoyed them oftener, and made better use of the opportunities
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
which I have had of examining the many interesting objects
that attracted my notice. And now, let me endeavour to describe the
habits of the Wood Duck, in so far as I have been able to apprehend
them.
</p>

<p>
This beautiful species ranges over the whole extent of the United
States, and I have seen it in all parts from Louisiana to the confines of
Maine, and from the vicinity of our Atlantic coasts as far inland as my
travels have extended. It also occurs sparingly during the breeding-season
in Nova Scotia; but farther north I did not observe it.
Everywhere in this immense tract I have found it an almost constant resident,
for some spend the winter even in Massachusetts, and far up the
warm spring waters of brooks on the Missouri. It confines itself, however,
entirely to fresh water, preferring at all times the secluded retreats
of the ponds, bayous, or creeks, that occur so profusely in our woods.
Well acquainted with man, they carefully avoid him, unless now and then
during the breeding-season, when, if a convenient spot is found by them
in which to deposit their eggs and raise their young, they will even locate
themselves about the miller’s dam.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is remarkable for its speed, and the ease and
elegance with which it is performed. The Wood Duck passes through
the woods and even amongst the branches of trees, with as much facility
as the Passenger Pigeon; and while removing from some secluded haunt
to its breeding-grounds, at the approach of night, it shoots over the trees
like a meteor, scarcely emitting any sound from its wings. In the lower
parts of Louisiana and Kentucky, where they abound, these regular excursions
are performed by flocks of from thirty to fifty or more individuals.
In several instances I have taken perhaps undue advantage of
their movements to shoot them on the wing, by placing myself between
their two different spots of resort, and keeping myself concealed. In this
manner I have obtained a number in the course of an hour of twilight;
and I have known some keen sportsmen kill as many as thirty or forty in
a single evening. This sport is best in the latter part of autumn, after
the old males have joined the flocks of young led by the females. Several
gunners may then obtain equal success by placing themselves at regular
distances in the line of flight, when the birds having in a manner
to run the gauntlet, more than half of a flock have been brought down in
the course of their transit. While passing through the air on such occasions,
the birds are never heard to emit a single note.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Wood Duck breeds in the Middle States about the beginning of
April, in Massachusetts a month later, and in Nova Scotia or on our
northern lakes, seldom before the first days of June. In Louisiana and
Kentucky, where I have had better opportunities of studying their habits
in this respect, they generally pair about the 1st of March, sometimes a
fortnight earlier. I never knew one of these birds to form a nest on the
ground, or on the branches of a tree. They appear at all times to prefer
the hollow broken portion of some large branch, the hole of our
largest Woodpecker (<i>Picus principalis</i>), or the deserted retreat of the
fox-squirrel; and I have frequently been surprised to see them go in
and out of a hole of any one of these, when their bodies while on wing
seemed to be nearly half as large again as the aperture within which they
had deposited their eggs. Once only I found a nest (with ten eggs) in
the fissure of a rock on the Kentucky River a few miles below Frankfort.
Generally, however, the holes to which they betake themselves are either
over deep swamps, above cane brakes, or broken branches of high sycamores,
seldom more than forty or fifty feet from the water. They are
much attached to their breeding-places, and for three successive years I
found a pair near Henderson, in Kentucky, with eggs in the beginning
of April, in the abandoned nest of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker. The
eggs, which are from six to fifteen, according to the age of the bird, are
placed on dry plants, feathers, and a scanty portion of down, which I believe
is mostly plucked from the breast of the female. They are perfectly
smooth, nearly elliptical, of a light colour between buff and pale green,
two inches in length by one and a half in diameter; the shell is about
equal in firmness to that of the Mallard’s egg, and quite smooth.
</p>

<p>
No sooner has the female completed her set of eggs than she is abandoned
by her mate, who now joins others, which form themselves into
considerable flocks, and thus remain apart until the young are able to fly,
when old and young of both sexes come together, and so remain until the
commencement of the next breeding season. In all the nests which I
have examined, I have been rather surprised to find a quantity of feathers
belonging to birds of other species, even those of the domestic fowl, and
particularly of the wild goose and wild turkey. On coming upon a nest
with eggs when the bird was absent in search of food, I have always found
the eggs covered over with feathers and down, although quite out of
sight, in the depth of a woodpecker’s or squirrel’s hole. On the contrary,
when the nest was placed in the broken branch of a tree, it could easily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
be observed from the ground, on account of the feathers, dead sticks, and
withered grasses about it. If the nest is placed immediately over the
water, the young, the moment they are hatched, scramble to the mouth
of the hole, launch into the air with their little wings and feet spread out,
and drop into their favourite element; but whenever their birth-place is
at some distance from it, the mother carries them to it one by one in her
bill, holding them so as not to injure their yet tender frame. On several
occasions, however, when the hole was thirty, forty, or more yards from a
bayou or other piece of water, I observed that the mother suffered the
young to fall on the grasses and dried leaves beneath the tree, and afterwards
led them directly to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek. At
this early age, the young answer to their parents’ call with a mellow <i>pee,
pee, pee</i>, often and rapidly repeated. The call of the mother at such times
is low, soft, and prolonged, resembling the syllables <i>pe-ēē, pe-ēē</i>. The
watch-note of the male, which resembles <i>hoe-ēēk</i>, is never uttered by the
female; indeed, the male himself seldom uses it unless alarmed by some
uncommon sound or the sight of a distant enemy, or when intent on calling
passing birds of his own species.
</p>

<p>
The young are carefully led along the shallow and grassy shores, and
taught to obtain their food, which at this early period consists of small
aquatic insects, flies, musquitoes, and seeds. As they grow up, you now
and then see the whole flock run as it were along the surface of the sluggish
stream in chase of a dragon-fly, or to pick up a grasshopper or locust
that has accidentally dropped upon it. They are excellent divers, and
when frightened instantly disappear, disperse below the surface, and make
for the nearest shore, on attaining which they run for the woods, squat in
any convenient place, and thus elude pursuit. I used two modes of procuring
them alive on such occasions. One was with a bag net, such as is
employed in catching our little partridge, and which I placed half sunk in
the water, driving the birds slowly, first within the wings, and finally
into the bag. In this manner I have caught young and old birds of this
species in considerable numbers. The other method I accidentally discovered
while on a shooting excursion, accompanied by an excellent
pointer dog. I observed that the sight of this faithful animal always
immediately frightened the young ducks to the shores, the old one taking
to her wings as soon as she conceived her brood to be safe. But the next
instant Juno would dash across the bayou or pond, reach the opposite
bank, and immediately follow on their track. In a few moments she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
would return with a duckling held between her <i>lips</i>, when I would take
it from her unhurt.
</p>

<p>
While residing at Henderson, I thought of taming a number of Wood
Ducks. In the course of a few days Juno procured for me, in the manner
above described, as many as I had a mind for, and they were conveyed
home in a bag. A dozen or more were placed in empty flour barrels,
and covered over for some hours, with the view of taming them the sooner.
Several of these barrels were placed in the yard, but whenever I went
and raised their lids, I found all the little ones hooked by their sharp
claws to the very edge of their prisons, and, the instant that room was
granted, they would tumble over and run off in all directions. I afterwards
frequently saw these young birds rise from the bottom to the brim
of a cask, by moving a few inches at a time up the side, and fixing foot
after foot by means of their diminutive hooked claws, which, in passing
over my hand, I found to have points almost as fine as those of a needle.
They fed freely on corn meal soaked in water, and as they grew, collected
flies with great expertness. When they were half-grown I gave them
great numbers of our common locusts yet unable to fly, which were gathered
by boys from the trunks of trees and the “iron weeds,” a species of
wild hemp very abundant in that portion of the country. These I would
throw to them on the water of the artificial pond which I had in my garden,
when the eagerness with which they would scramble and fight for
them always afforded me great amusement. They grew up apace, when
I pinioned them all, and they subsequently bred in my grounds in boxes
which I had placed conveniently over the water, with a board or sticks
leading to them, and an abundant supply of proper materials for a nest
placed in them.
</p>

<p>
Few birds are more interesting to observe during the love season than
Wood Ducks. The great beauty and neatness of their apparel, and the
grace of their motions, always afford pleasure to the observer; and, as I
have had abundant opportunities of studying their habits at that period,
I am enabled to present you with a full account of their proceedings.
</p>

<p>
When March has again returned, and the Dogwood expands its pure
blossoms to the sun, the Cranes soar away on their broad wings, bidding
our country adieu for a season, flocks of water-fowls are pursuing their
early migrations, the frogs issue from their muddy beds to pipe a few notes
of languid joy, the Swallow has just arrived, and the Bluebird has returned
to his box. The Wood Duck almost alone remains on the pool,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
as if to afford us an opportunity of studying the habits of its tribe. Here
they are, a whole flock of beautiful birds, the males chasing their rivals,
the females coquetting with their chosen beaux. Observe that fine drake!
how gracefully he raises his head and curves his neck! As he bows before
the object of his love, he raises for a moment his silken crest. His
throat is swelled, and from it there issues a guttural sound, which to his
beloved is as sweet as the song of the Wood Thrush to its gentle mate.
The female, as if not unwilling to manifest the desire to please which she
really feels, swims close by his side, now and then caresses him by touching
his feathers with her bill, and shews displeasure towards any other of
her sex that may come near. Soon the happy pair separate from the rest,
repeat every now and then their caresses, and at length, having sealed the
conjugal compact, fly off to the woods to search for a large woodpecker’s
hole. Occasionally the males fight with each other, but their combats are
not of long duration, nor is the field ever stained with blood, the loss of a
few feathers or a sharp tug of the head being generally enough to decide
the contest. Although the Wood Ducks always form their nests in the
hollow of a tree, their caresses are performed exclusively on the water, to
which they resort for the purpose, even when their loves have been first
proved far above the ground on a branch of some tall sycamore. While
the female is depositing her eggs, the male is seen to fly swiftly past the
hole in which she is hidden, erecting his crest, and sending forth his love-notes,
to which she never fails to respond.
</p>

<p>
On the ground the Wood Duck runs nimbly and with more grace
than most other birds of its tribe. On reaching the shore of a pond or
stream, it immediately shakes its tail sidewise, looks around, and proceeds
in search of food. It moves on the larger branches of trees with the same
apparent ease; and, while looking at thirty or forty of these birds perched
on a single sycamore on the bank of a secluded bayou, I have conceived
the sight as pleasing as any that I have ever enjoyed. They always reminded
me of the Muscovy Duck, of which they look as if a highly
finished and flattering miniature. They frequently prefer walking on an
inclined log or the fallen trunk of a tree, one end of which lies in the
water, while the other rests on the steep bank, to betaking themselves to
flight at the sight of an approaching enemy. In this manner I have seen
a whole flock walk from the water into the woods, as a steamer was approaching
them in the eddies of the Ohio or Mississippi. They swim
and dive well, when wounded and closely pursued, often stopping at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
edge of the water with nothing above it but the bill, but at other times
running to a considerable distance into the woods, or hiding in a cane-brake
beside a log. In such places I have often found them, having been
led to their place of concealment by my dog. When frightened, they rise
by a single spring from the water, and are as apt to make directly for the
woods as to follow the stream. When they discover an enemy while
under the covert of shrubs or other plants on a pond, instead of taking to
wing, they swim off in silence among the thickest weeds, so as generally to
elude your search, by landing and running over a narrow piece of ground
to another pond. In autumn, a whole covey may often be seen standing
or sitting on a floating log, pluming and cleaning themselves for hours.
On such occasions the knowing sportsman commits great havock among
them, killing half a dozen or more at a shot.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Wood Duck, or as it is called in the Western and
Southern States, the Summer Duck, consists of acorns, beech-nuts, grapes,
and berries of various sorts, for which they <i>half-dive</i>, in the manner of
the Mallard for example, or search under the trees on the shores and in
the woods, turning over the fallen leaves with dexterity. In the Carolinas,
they resort under night to the rice fields, as soon as the grain becomes
milky. They also devour insects, snails, tadpoles, and small water
lizards, swallowing at the same time a quantity of sand or gravel to aid
the trituration of their food.
</p>

<p>
The best season in which to procure these birds for the table is from
the beginning of September until the first frost, their flesh being then
tender, juicy, and in my opinion excellent. They are easily caught in
figure-of-four traps. I know a person now residing in South Carolina,
who has caught several hundreds in the course of a week, bringing them
home in bags across his horse’s saddle, and afterwards feeding them in
coops on Indian corn. In that State, they are bought in the markets for
thirty or forty cents the pair. At Boston, where I found them rather
abundant during winter, they bring nearly double that price; but in
Ohio or Kentucky twenty-five cents are considered an equivalent. Their
feathers are as good as those of any other species; and I feel well assured
that, with a few years of care, the Wood Duck might be perfectly domesticated,
when it could not fail to be as valuable as it is beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Their sense of hearing is exceedingly acute, and by means of it they
often save themselves from their wily enemies the minx, the polecat, and
the racoon. The vile snake that creeps into their nest and destroys their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' href='#Page_59'>59</a></span>
eggs, is their most pernicious enemy on land. The young, when on the
water, have to guard against the snapping turtle, the gar-fish, and the
eel, and in the Southern Districts, against the lashing tail and the tremendous
jaws of the alligator.
</p>

<p>
Those which breed in Maine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, move
southward as soon as the frosts commence, and none are known to spend
the winter so far north. I have been much surprised to find <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>
speaking of the Wood Ducks as a species of which more than five or six
individuals are seldom seen together. A would-be naturalist in America,
who has had better opportunities of knowing its habits than the admired
author of the “American Ornithology,” repeats the same error, and, I
am told, believes that all his statements are considered true. For my own
part, I assure you, I have seen hundreds in a single flock, and have known
fifteen to be killed by a single shot. They, however, raise only one brood
in the season, unless their eggs or young have been destroyed. Should
this happen, the female soon finds means of recalling her mate from the
flock which he has joined.
</p>

<p>
On having recourse to a journal written by me at Henderson nearly
twenty years ago, I find it stated that the attachment of a male to a female
lasts only during one breeding season; and that the males provide themselves
with mates in succession, the strongest taking the first choice, and
the weakest being content with what remains. The young birds which
I raised, never failed to make directly for the Ohio, whenever they escaped
from the grounds, although they never had been there before. The only
other circumstances which I have to mention are, that when entering the
hole in which its nest is, the bird dives as it were into it at once, and does
not alight first against the tree; that I have never witnessed an instance
of its taking possession, by force, of a woodpecker’s hole; and lastly,
that during winter they allow ducks of different species to associate with
them.

The tree represented in the plate is the <i>Platanus occidentalis</i>, which
in different parts of the United States is known by the names of Buttonwood,
Sycamore, Plane-tree, and Water Beech, and in Canada by that
of Cotton-tree. It is one of our largest trees, and on the banks of our
great western and southern rivers, often attains a diameter of eight or ten
feet. Although naturally inclined to prefer the vicinity of water, it grows
in almost every kind of situation, and thrives even in the streets of several
of our eastern cities, such as Philadelphia and New York.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCVII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
As the Marion was nearing the curious islets of the Tortugas, one of
the birds that more particularly attracted my notice was of this species.
The nearer we approached the land, the more numerous did they become,
and I felt delighted with the hope that ere many days should elapse, I
should have an opportunity of studying their habits. As night drew her
sombre curtain over the face of nature, some of these birds alighted on
the top-yard of our bark, and I observed ever afterwards that they manifested
a propensity to roost at as great a height as possible above the surrounding
objects, making choice of the tops of bushes, or even upright
poles, and disputing with each other the privilege. The first that was
shot at, was approached with considerable difficulty: it had alighted on
the prong of a tree which had floated and been fastened to the bottom of
a rocky shallow at some distance from shore; the water was about four
feet deep and quite rough; sharks we well knew were abundant around
us; but the desire to procure the bird was too strong to be overcome by
such obstacles. In an instant, the pilot and myself were over the sides
of the boat, and onward we proceeded with our guns cocked and ready.
The yawl was well manned, and its crew awaiting the result. After we
had struggled through the turbulent waters about a hundred yards, my
companion raised his gun and fired; but away flew the bird with a broken
leg, and we saw no more of it that day. Next day, however, at the same
hour, the Booby was seen perched on the same prong, where, after resting
about three hours, it made off to the open sea, doubtless in search of
food.
</p>

<p>
About eight miles to the north-east of the Tortugas Lighthouse, lies
a small sand-bar a few acres in extent, called Booby Island, on account
of the number of birds of this species that resort to it during the breeding-season,
and to it we accordingly went. We found it not more than
a few feet above the surface of the water, but covered with Boobies, which
lay basking in the sunshine, and pluming themselves. Our attempt to
land on the island before the birds should fly off, proved futile, for before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
we were within fifty yards of it, they had all betaken themselves to flight,
and were dispersing in various directions. We landed, however, distributed
ourselves in different parts, and sent the boat to some distance, the
pilot assuring us that the birds would return. And so it happened. As
they approached, we laid ourselves as flat as possible in the sand, and although
none of them alighted, we attained our object, for in a couple of
hours we procured thirty individuals of both sexes and of different ages,
finding little difficulty in bringing them down as they flew over us at a
moderate height. The wounded birds that fell on the ground made immediately
for the water, moving with more ease than I had expected from
the accounts usually given of the awkward motions of these birds on the
land. Those which reached the water swam off with great buoyancy, and
with such rapidity, that it took much rowing to secure some of them,
while most of those that fell directly into the sea with only a wing
broken, escaped. The island was covered with their dung, the odour of
which extended to a considerable distance leeward. In the evening of the
same day we landed on another island, named after the Noddy, and thickly
covered with bushes and low trees, to which thousands of that species
of Tern resort for the purpose of breeding. There also we found a great
number of Boobies. They were perched on the top-branches of the trees,
on which they had nests, and here again we obtained as many as we desired.
They flew close over our heads, eyeing us with dismay but in silence;
indeed, not one of these birds ever emitted a cry, except at the moment
when they rose from their perches or from the sand. Their note is
harsh and guttural, somewhat like that of a strangled pig, and resembling
the syllables <i>hork, hork</i>.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Booby is placed on the top of a bush at a height of
from four to ten feet. It is large and flat, formed of a few dry sticks,
covered and matted with sea-weeds in great quantity. I have no doubt
that they return to the same nest many years in succession, and repair it
as occasion requires. In all the nests which I examined, only one egg
was found, and as most of the birds were sitting, and some of the eggs
had the chick nearly ready for exclusion, it is probable that these birds
raise only a single young one, like the Common Gannet or Solan Goose.
The egg is of a dull white colour, without spots, and about the size of
that of a common hen, but more elongated, being
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> inches in length,
with a diameter of
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>. In some nests they were covered with filth
from the parent bird, in the manner of the Florida Cormorant. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
young, which had an uncouth appearance, were covered with down; the
bill and feet of a deep livid blue or indigo colour. On being touched,
they emitted no cry, but turned away their heads at every trial. A great
quantity of fish lay beneath the trees in a state of putrefaction, proving
how abundantly the young birds were supplied by their parents. Indeed,
while we were on Noddy Island, there was a constant succession of birds
coming in from the sea with food for their young, consisting chiefly of
flying-fish and small mullets, which they disgorged in a half macerated
state into the open throats of their offspring. Unfortunately the time
afforded me on that coast was not sufficient to enable me to trace the progress
of their growth. I observed, however, that none of the birds which
were still brown had nests, and that they roosted apart, particularly on
Booby Island, where also many barren ones usually resorted, to lie on the
sand and bask in the sun.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Booby is graceful and extremely protracted. They
pass swiftly at a height of from twenty yards to a foot or two from the
surface, often following the troughs of the waves to a considerable distance,
their wings extended at right angles to the body; then, without any apparent
effort, raising themselves and allowing the rolling waters to break
beneath them, when they tack about, and sweep along in a contrary
direction in search of food, much in the manner of the true Petrels.
Now, if you follow an individual, you see that it suddenly stops short,
plunges headlong into the water, pierces with its powerful beak and secures
a fish, emerges again with inconceivable ease, after a short interval
rises on wing, performs a few wide circlings, and makes off toward some
shore. At this time its flight is different, being performed by flappings
for twenty or thirty paces, with alternate sailings of more than double
that space. When overloaded with food, they alight on the water, where,
if undisturbed, they appear to remain for hours at a time, probably until
digestion has afforded them relief.
</p>

<p>
The range to which this species confines itself along our coast, seldom
extends beyond Cape Hatteras to the eastward, but they become more and
more numerous the farther south we proceed. They breed abundantly
on all such islands or keys as are adapted for the purpose, on the southern
and western coasts of the Floridas and in the Gulf of Mexico, where I
was told they breed on the sand-bars. Their power of wing seems sufficient
to enable them to brave the tempest, while during a continuance of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
fair weather they venture to a great distance seaward, and I have seen
them fully 200 miles from land.
</p>

<p>
The expansibility of the gullet of this species enables it to swallow
fishes of considerable size, and on such occasions their mouth seems to
spread to an unusual width. In the throats of several individuals that
were shot as they were returning to their nests, I found mullets measuring
seven or eight inches, that must have weighed fully half a pound.
Their body beneath the skin, is covered with numerous air-cells, which
probably assist them in raising or lowering themselves while on wing, and
perhaps still more so when on the point of performing the rapid plunge
by which they secure their prey.
</p>

<p>
Their principal enemies during the breeding-season are the American
Crow and the Fish Crow, both of which destroy their eggs, and the Turkey
Buzzard, which devours their young while yet unfledged. They
breed during the month of May, but I have not been able to ascertain if
they raise more than one brood in the season. The adult birds chase
away those which are yet immature during the period of incubation. It
would seem that they take several years in attaining their perfect state.
</p>

<p>
When procured alive, they feed freely, and may be kept any length
of time, provided they are supplied with fish. No other food, however,
could I tempt them to swallow, excepting slices of turtle, which after all
they did not seem to relish. In no instance did I observe one drinking.
Some authors have stated that the Frigate Pelican and the Lestris force
the Booby to disgorge its food that they may obtain it; but this I have
never witnessed. Like the Common Gannet, they may be secured by
fastening a fish to a soft plank, and sinking it a few feet beneath the surface
of the water, for if they perceive the bait, which they are likely to
do if they pass over it, they plunge headlong upon it, and drive their bill
into the wood.
</p>

<p>
When a Booby has alighted on the spar of a vessel, it is no easy matter
to catch it, unless it is much fatigued; but if exhausted and asleep,
an expert seaman may occasionally secure one. I was informed that after
the breeding-season, these birds roost on trees in company with the
Brown Pelican and a species of Tern, <i>Sterna stolida</i>, and spend their
hours of daily rest on the sand-banks. Our pilot, who, as I have mentioned
in my second volume, was a man of great observation, assured me
that while at Vera Cruz, he saw the fishermen there go to sea, and return
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' href='#Page_67'>67</a></span>
from considerable distances, simply by following the course of the
Boobies.
</p>

<p>
The bills and legs of those which I procured in the brown plumage,
and which were from one to two years of age, were dusky blue. These were
undergoing moult on the 14th of May. At a more advanced age, the
parts mentioned become paler, and when the bird has arrived at maturity,
are as represented in my plate. I observed no external difference between
the sexes in the adult birds. The stomach is a long dilatable pouch, thin,
and of a yellow colour. The body is muscular, and the flesh, which is of
a dark colour, tough, and having a disagreeable smell, is scarcely fit for
food.
</p>

<p>
I am unable to find a good reason for those who have chosen to call
these birds <i>boobies</i>. Authors, it is true, generally represent them as extremely
<i>stupid</i>; but to me the word is utterly inapplicable to any bird
with which I am acquainted. The Woodcock, too, is said to be stupid,
as are many other birds; but my opinion, founded on pretty extensive
observation, is, that it is only when birds of any species are unacquainted
with man, that they manifest that kind of <i>ignorance</i> or <i>innocence</i> which
he calls <i>stupidity</i>, and by which they suffer themselves to be imposed upon.
A little acquaintance with him soon enables them to perceive enough
of his character to induce them to keep aloof. This I observed in the
Booby Gannet, as well as in the Noddy Tern, and in certain species of
land birds of which I have already spoken. After my first visit to Booby
Island in the Tortugas, the Gannets had already become very shy and
wary, and before the Marion sailed away from those peaceful retreats of
the wandering sea-birds, the <i>Boobies</i> had become so knowing, that the most
expert of our party could not get within shot of them.

<h2>
ESQUIMAUX CURLEW.

<p>
I regret that I am unable to present a complete history of the Esquimaux
Curlew. It is true I might somewhat enlarge my account of
its habits, were I to borrow from others, but as I have resolved to confine
myself to the results of my own observation, unless in certain cases, in
which I always take care to give my authorities, I hope you will be
pleased with the little which I have to offer.
</p>

<p>
Previous to my voyage to Labrador, I had seen only a single bird of
this species, which was kindly given me by my learned friend <span class="smcap">William
Oakes</span>, Esq. of Ipswich, Massachusetts, who had procured it in his immediate
neighbourhood, where, as I have since ascertained, the Esquimaux
Curlew spends a few days in early autumn, while on its way southward.
During their short stay in that State, they are met with on the high
sandy hills near the sea-shore, where they feed on the grasshoppers and on
several kinds of berries. On this food they become fat, so as to afford
excellent eating, in consequence of which they have probably acquired
the name of “Dough Bird,” which they bear in that district, but which
is also applied to several other birds. How this species manages to cross
the whole extent of the United States without being seen after leaving
Massachusetts, is to me very wonderful. On one occasion only have I
ever had a glimpse of it. I was in company with my learned and generous
friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> of Charleston, on one of the islands on the
coast of South Carolina, whither we had gone with the view of watching
the Long-billed Curlews (<i>Numenius longirostris</i>). It was at the dawn
of a fine day, when a dense flock of the northern Curlews passed to the
southward, near enough to enable us to ascertain the species, but so swiftly,
that in a few minutes they were quite out of sight.
</p>

<p>
On the 29th of July 1833, during a thick fog, the Esquimaux Curlews
made their first appearance in Labrador, near the harbour of Bras
d’Or. They evidently came from the north, and arrived in such dense
flocks as to remind me of the Passenger Pigeons. The weather was extremely
cold as well as foggy. For more than a week we had been looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
for them, as was every fisherman in the harbour, these birds being
considered there, as indeed they are, great delicacies. The birds at length
came, flock after flock, passed close round our vessel, and directed their
course toward the sterile mountainous tracts in the neighbourhood; and
as soon as the sun’s rays had dispersed the fogs that hung over the land,
our whole party went off in search of them.
</p>

<p>
I was not long in discovering that their stay on this coast was occasioned
solely by the density of the mists and the heavy gales that already
gave intimation of the approaching close of the summer; for whenever
the weather cleared up a little, thousands of them set off and steered in
a straight course across the broad Gulf of St Lawrence. On the contrary,
when the wind was high, and the fogs thick, they flew swiftly and
low over the rocky surface of the country, as if bewildered. Wherever
there was a spot that seemed likely to afford a supply of food, there the
Curlews abounded, and were easily approached. By the 12th of August,
however, they had all left the country.
</p>

<p>
In Labrador they feed on what the fishermen call the Curlew berry,
a small black fruit growing on a creeping shrub, not more than an inch
or two in height, and so abundant, that patches of several acres covered
the rocks here and there. When the birds were in search of these feeding-grounds,
they flew in close masses, sometimes high, at other times
low, but always with remarkable speed, and performing beautiful evolutions
in the air. The appearance of man did not seem to intimidate them,
for they would alight so near us, or pass over our heads at so short a distance,
that we easily shot them. While on wing, they emitted an oft repeated
soft whistling note, but the moment they alighted they became silent.
They ran swiftly along, all in the same direction, picking up the
berries in their way, and when pursued, would immediately squat in the
manner of a snipe or partridge, sometimes even laying their neck and head
quite flat on the ground, until you came within a short distance, when,
at the single whistle of any one of the flock, they would all immediately
scream and fly off, rambling about for a while, and not unfrequently realighting
on the same spot. Now and then, however, their excursion
would last a long time, they would rise high in the air, make towards the
sea, and, as if aware of the unfavourable state of the weather for pursuing
their southward course, would return.
</p>

<p>
They continued to arrive at Bras d’Or for several days, in flocks which
seemed to me to increase in number. I saw no Hawks in their rear, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
I was the more astonished at this, that at that period the Pigeon Hawk
and Petit Caporal Hawk were pretty abundant.
</p>

<p>
They rose from the ground by a single quick spring, in the manner
of a snipe, when they would cut backward, forward, and all around, in a
very curious manner, and would now and then pause in the air, like a
Hawk, remaining stationary for a few moments with their head meeting
the wind, when immediately afterwards they would all suddenly alight.
In calm and fair weather, they were more shy than at other times.
While on their passage across the Gulf, they flew high in close bodies,
and with their usual speed, by no means in regular lines, nor in any order,
but much in the manner of the Migratory Pigeon, now and then
presenting a broad front, and again coming together so as to form a close
body.
</p>

<p>
Those which we procured were extremely fat and juicy, especially the
young birds, of which we ate a good many. Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, an old settler
of Bras d’Or, and his son, shoot a great number every season, which
they salt for winter food. They informed us that these birds pass over
the same tract about the middle of May, on their way northward, and
that they never found them breeding in their neighbourhood. Little difference
could be observed at that season between the males and females,
or between the old and young birds.

WILSON’S PLOVER.

<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCIX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
Reader, imagine yourself standing motionless on some of the sandy
shores between South Carolina and the extremity of Florida, waiting with
impatience for the return of day;—or, if you dislike the idea, imagine
me there. The air is warm and pleasant, the smooth sea reflects the
feeble glimmerings of the fading stars, the sound of living thing is not
heard; nature, universal nature, is at rest. And here am I, inhaling
the grateful sea-air, with eyes intent on the dim distance. See the bright
blaze that issues from the verge of the waters! and now the sun himself
appears, and all is life, or seems to be; for as the influence of the Divinity
is to the universe, so is that of the sun to the things of this world.
Far away beyond that treacherous reef, floats a gallant bark, that seems
slumbering on the bosom of the waters like a silvery sea-bird. Gentle
breezes now creep over the ocean, and ruffle its surface into tiny wavelets.
The ship glides along, the fishes leap with joy, and on my ear comes the
well known note of the bird which bears the name of one whom every ornithologist
must honour. Long have I known the bird myself, and yet
desirous of knowing it better, I have returned to this beach many successive
seasons for the purpose of observing its ways, examining its nest,
marking the care with which it rears its young, and the attachment which
it manifests to its mate. Well, let the scene vanish! and let me present
you with the results of my observations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s Plover! I love the name because of the respect I bear towards
him to whose memory the bird has been dedicated. How pleasing,
I have thought, it would have been to me, to have met with him on such
an excursion, and, after having procured a few of his own birds, to have
listened to him as he would speak of a thousand interesting facts connected
with his favourite science and my ever-pleasing pursuits. How delightful
to have talked, among other things, of the probable use of the <i>double claws</i>
which I have found attached to the toes of the species which goes by his
name, and which are also seen in other groups of shore and sea birds. Perhaps
he might have informed me why the claws of some birds are pectinated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
on one toe and not on the rest, and why that toe itself is so cut. But alas!
Wilson was with me only a few times, and then <i>nothing</i> worthy of his
attention was procured.
</p>

<p>
This interesting species, which always looks to me as if in form a
miniature copy of the Black-bellied Plover, is a constant resident in
the southern districts of the Union. There it breeds, and there too
it spends the winter. Many individuals, no doubt, move farther south,
but great numbers are at all times to be met with from Carolina to
the mouths of the Mississippi, and in all these places I have found it
the whole year round. Some go as far to the eastward as Long Island
in the State of New York, where, however, they are considered as rarities;
but beyond this, none, I believe, are seen along our eastern shores.
This circumstance has seemed the more surprising to me, that its relative
the Piping Plover proceeds as far as the Magdeleine Islands; and that
the latter bird should also breed in the Carolinas a month earlier than
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s Plover ever does, seems to me not less astonishing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s Plover begins to lay its eggs about the time when the young
of the Piping Plover are running after their parents. Twenty or thirty
yards from the uppermost beat of the waves, on the first of June, or
some day not distant from it, the female may be seen scratching a small
cavity in the shelly sand, in which she deposits four eggs, placing them
carefully with the broad end outermost. The eggs, which measure an
inch and a quarter by seven and a half eighths, are of a dull cream colour,
sparingly sprinkled all over with dots of pale purple and spots of
dark brown. The eggs vary somewhat in size, and in their ground colour,
but less than those of many other species of the genus. The young
follow their parents as soon as they are hatched, and the latter employ
every artifice common to birds of this family, to entice their enemies to
follow them and thus save their offspring.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is rapid, elegant, and protracted. While
travelling from one sand-beach or island to another, they fly low over the
land or water, emitting a fine clear soft note. Now and then, when after
the breeding season they form into flocks of twenty or thirty, they perform
various evolutions in the air, cutting backwards and forwards, as if
inspecting the spot on which they wish to alight, and then suddenly
descend, sometimes on the sea-beach, and sometimes on the more elevated
sands at a little distance from it. They do not run so nimbly as the Piping
Plovers, nor are they nearly so shy. I have in fact frequently walked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
up so as to be within ten yards or so of them. They seldom mix with
other species, and they shew a decided preference to solitary uninhabited
spots.
</p>

<p>
Their food consists principally of small marine insects, minute shellfish,
and sandworms, with which they mix particles of sand. Towards
autumn they become almost silent, and being then very plump, afford delicious
eating. They feed fully as much by night as by day, and the
large eyes of this as of other species of the genus, seem to fit them for
nocturnal searchings.
</p>

<p>
The young birds assemble together, and spend the winter months
apart from the old ones, which are easily recognised by their lighter
tints. While in the Floridas, near St Augustine, in the months of December
and January, I found this species much more abundant than any
other; and there were few of the Keys that had a sandy beach, or a rocky
shore, on which one or more pairs were not observed.

<p>
One morning while I was at the Cincinnati Museum in the State of
Ohio, a woman came in holding in her apron one of this delicate species
alive, which she said had fallen down the chimney of her house under
night, and which, when she awoke at daybreak, was the first object she
saw, it having perched on one of the bed posts. It was a young bird.
I placed it on the table before me, and drew from it the figure on the
left of my plate. It stood perfectly still for two hours, but on my touching
it with a pencil, after my drawing was done, it flew off and alighted
on the cornice of a window. Replacing it on the table, I took two books
and laid them so as to leave before it a passage of an inch and a half,
through which it walked with ease. Bringing the books nearer each
other, so as to reduce the passage to one inch, I tried the Bittern again,
and again it made its way between them without moving either. When
dead, its body measured two inches and a quarter across, from which it
is apparent that this species, as well as the Gallinules and Rails, is enabled
to contract its breadth in an extraordinary degree.
</p>

<p>
While I was in Philadelphia, in September 1832, a gentleman presented
me with a pair of adult birds of this species, alive and in perfect
plumage. They had been caught in a meadow a few miles below the
city, and I kept them alive several days, feeding them on small fish and
thin stripes of pork. They were expert at seizing flies, and swallowed
caterpillars, and other insects. My wife admired them much on account
of their gentle deportment, for although on being tormented, they would
spread their wings, ruffle their feathers, and draw back their head as if
to strike, yet they suffered themselves to be touched by any one without
pecking at his hand. It was amusing to see them continually attempting
to escape through the windows, climbing with ease from the floor to
the top of the curtain by means of their feet and claws. This feat they
would repeat whenever they were taken down. The experiment of the
books was tried with them, and succeeded as at Cincinnati. At the approach
of night they became much more lively, walked about the room,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
in a graceful manner with much agility, and generally kept close together.
I had ample opportunities of studying their natural positions,
and drew both of them in the attitudes exhibited in the plate. I would
gladly have kept them longer; but as I was bound for the south, I had
them killed for the purpose of preserving their skins.
</p>

<p>
This bird ranges over most part of the United States, but is nowhere
to be found in tolerable abundance excepting about the mouths of the
Mississippi and the Southern portions of the Floridas, especially the
“Ever-glades.” I have met with them to the eastward as far as New
Brunswick, on our large lakes, and in the intermediate portions of the
country, although I have seldom found more than one or two at a time.
In the Floridas and Carolinas they have been known to breed in small communities
of four or five pairs. One instance of this was observed by my
friend Dr <span class="smcap">Horlbeck</span> of Charleston, and Dr <span class="smcap">Leitner</span>, another friend of
mine, found them quite abundant in certain portions of the Florida
marshes.

Although the Least Bittern is not unfrequently started in salt marshes,
it gives a decided preference to the borders of ponds, lakes or bayous of
fresh water, and it is in secluded situations of this kind that it usually
forms its nest. This is sometimes placed on the ground, amid the rankest
grasses, but more frequently it is attached to the stems several inches
above it. It is flat, composed of dried or rotten weeds, and in shape resembles
that of the Louisiana Heron, although this latter employs nothing
but sticks. The eggs are three or four, seldom more, of a dull
yellowish-green, without spots, an inch and a quarter in length, almost
equal at both ends.
</p>

<p>
When the young are yet quite small, their heads are covered with large
tufts of reddish down, their bill is very short, and they sit on their rump
with their legs extended on each side before their body, in the manner of
young Herons. If disturbed when about two weeks old, they leave the nest
and scramble through the grass with celerity, clinging to the blades with
their sharp claws whenever this is necessary. At a later period they
seem to await the coming of their parents with impatience; and if no
noise is made, you may hear them calling continually in a low croaking
voice for half an hour at a time. As soon as they are able to fly, they
not unfrequently alight on the branches of trees to escape from their various
enemies, such as minxes and water snakes, the latter of which destroy
a good number of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In two instances, I found the nests of the Least Bittern about three
feet above the ground, in a thick cluster of smilax and other briary plants.
In the first, two nests were placed in the same bush, within a few yards of
each other. In the other instance there was only one nest of this bird,
but several of the Boat-tailed Grakle, and one of the Green Heron, the
occupants of all of which seemed to be on friendly terms. When startled
from the nest, the old birds emit a few notes resembling the syllable <i>quā</i>,
alight a few yards off, and watch all your movements. If you go towards
them, you may sometimes take the female with the hand, but rarely the
male, who generally flies off, or makes his way through the woods. Its
ordinary cry, however, is a rough croak resembling that of the Great Blue
Heron, but much weaker.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird is apparently weak by day, for then it seldom
removes to a greater distance than a hundred yards at a time, and this,
too, only when frightened in a moderate degree, for, if much alarmed, it
falls again among the grass in the manner of the Rail; but in the dusk
of the evening and morning I have seen it passing steadily along, at the
height of fifty years or more, with the neck retracted, and the legs
stretched out behind, in the manner of the larger Herons. On such occasions
it uttered, at short intervals, its peculiar cry, and continued its
flight until out of sight. Several individuals were together, and I imagined
them to be proceeding in search of breeding-grounds, or on a migratory
expedition. When disturbed by day, they fly with extended
neck and dangling legs, and are easily shot, as their course is generally
direct and their flight slow. When walking, it shoots its head forward
at every step, as if about to thrust its bill into some substance; and, if
you attempt to lay hold of it when disabled, it is apt to inflict a painful
wound.
</p>

<p>
The food of this bird consists of snails, slugs, tadpoles, or young
frogs and water-lizards. In several instances, however, I have found
small shrews and field-mice in their stomach. Although more nocturnal
than diurnal, it moves a good deal about by day in search of food. About
noon, being doubtless much fatigued, they are not unfrequently observed
standing erect on one foot, and so soundly asleep as to be easily knocked
down or even caught by the hand, if cautiously approached. This very
remarkable habit of both our species of Bittern has brought upon them
the charge of extreme <i>stupidity</i>, whence the name of <i>Butor</i> given to them
by the Creoles of Louisiana. Whether or not this term be appropriate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
to the case, I leave for you to determine; but, my opinion is, that the
animal truly deserving to be called stupid, yet remains to be discovered,
and that the quality designated by that epithet occurs nowhere else than
among the individuals of that species which so thoughtlessly applies the
opprobrium.

I have lately received a letter from my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, stating
that he had found this species breeding in considerable numbers on
the plantation of <span class="smcap">James H. Smith</span>, Esq. six miles east of Charleston,
where he procured specimens both of the birds and of their eggs. Mr
<span class="smcap">Smith</span>’s sons had killed, in the course of a couple of weeks, not less than
fourteen of these diminutive Herons. He describes the nest as flat, composed
of pieces of dry rushes about a foot in length, and placed in a bunch
of Juncus effusus. The eggs were nearly white with a very light tinge
of blue.

<h2>
THE EGGERS OF LABRADOR.
</h2>

<p>
The distinctive appellation of Eggers is given to certain persons who
follow, principally or exclusively, the avocation of procuring the eggs of
wild birds, with the view of disposing of them at some distant port. Their
great object is to plunder every nest, whenever they can find it, no matter
where, and at whatever risk. They are the pest of the feathered
tribes, and their brutal propensity to destroy the poor creatures after they
have robbed them, is abundantly gratified whenever an opportunity presents
itself.
</p>

<p>
Much had been said to me respecting these destructive pirates before
I visited the coast of Labrador, but I could not entirely credit all their
cruelties until I had actually witnessed their proceedings, which were
such as to inspire no small degree of horror. But you shall judge for
yourself.
</p>

<p>
See yon shallop shyly sailing along;—she sneaks like a thief, wishing
as it were to shun the very light of heaven. Under the lea of every rocky
isle some one at the tiller steers her course. Were his trade an honest
one, he would not think of hiding his back behind the terrific rocks that
seem to have been placed there as a resort to the myriads of birds that
annually visit this desolate region of the earth, for the purpose of rearing
their young, at a distance from all disturbers of their peace. How unlike
the open, the bold, the honest mariner, whose face needs no mask, who
scorns to skulk under any circumstances! The vessel herself is a shabby
thing:—her sails are patched with stolen pieces of better canvass, the
owners of which have probably been stranded on some inhospitable coast,
and have been plundered, perhaps murdered, by the wretches before us.
Look at her again!—Her sides are neither painted, nor even pitched; no—they
are daubed over, plastered and patched with stripes of seal-skins,
laid along the seams. Her deck has never been washed or sanded, her
hold—for no cabin has she,—though at present empty, sends forth an
odour pestilential as that of a charnel-house. The crew, eight in number,
lie sleeping at the foot of their tottering mast, regardless of the repairs
needed in every part of her rigging. But see! she scuds along, and as I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
suspect her crew to be bent on the commission of some evil deed, let us
follow her to the first harbour.
</p>

<p>
There rides the filthy thing! The afternoon is half over. Her crew
have thrown their boat overboard; they enter and seat themselves, each
with a rusty gun. One of them skulls the skiff towards an island for a
century past the breeding place of myriads of Guillemots, which are now
to be laid under contribution. At the approach of the vile thieves, clouds
of birds rise from the rock and fill the air around, wheeling and screaming
over their enemies. Yet thousands remain in an erect posture, each
covering its single egg, the hope of both parents. The reports of several
muskets loaded with heavy shot are now heard, while several dead and
wounded birds fall heavily on the rock or into the water. Instantly all
the sitting birds rise and fly off affrighted to their companions above, and
hover in dismay over their assassins, who walk forward exultingly, and
with their shouts mingling oaths and execrations. Look at them! See
how they crush the chick within its shell, how they trample on every egg
in their way with their huge and clumsy boots. Onward they go, and
when they leave the isle, not an egg that they can find is left entire. The
dead birds they collect and carry to their boat. Now they have regained
their filthy shallop; they strip the birds by a single jerk of their feathery
apparel, while the flesh is yet warm, and throw them on some coals, where
in a short time they are broiled. The rum is produced when the guillemots
are fit for eating, and after stuffing themselves with this oily fare,
and enjoying the pleasure of beastly intoxication, over they tumble on the
deck of their crazed craft, where they pass the short hours of night in
turbid slumber.
</p>

<p>
The sun now rises above the snow-clad summit of the eastern mount.
“Sweet is the breath of morn” even in this desolate land. The gay Bunting
erects his white crest, and gives utterance to the joy he feels in the
presence of his brooding mate. The Willow Grous on the rock crows
his challenge aloud. Each floweret, chilled by the night air, expands its
pure petals; the gentle breeze shakes from the blades of grass the heavy
dewdrops. On the Guillemot Isle the birds have again settled, and now renew
their loves. Startled by the light of day, one of the Eggers springs
on his feet and rouses his companions, who stare around them for a while,
endeavouring to recollect their senses. Mark them, as with clumsy fingers
they clear their drowsy eyes! Slowly they rise on their feet. See
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
how the filthy lubbers stretch out their arms and yawn; you shrink back,
for verily “that throat might frighten a shark.”
</p>

<p>
But the master, soon recollecting that so many eggs are worth a dollar
or a crown, casts his eye towards the rock, marks the day in his memory,
and gives orders to depart. The light breeze enables them to reach another
harbour a few miles distant, one which, like the last, lies concealed
from the ocean by some other rocky isle. Arrived there, they re-act the
scene of yesterday, crushing every egg they can find. For a week each
night is passed in drunkenness and brawls, until, having reached the last
breeding place on the coast, they return, touch at every isle in succession,
shoot as many birds as they need, collect the fresh eggs, and lay in a
cargo. At every step each ruffian picks up an egg so beautiful that any
man with a feeling heart would pause to consider the motive which could
induce him to carry it off. But nothing of this sort occurs to the Egger,
who gathers and gathers, until he has swept the rock bare. The dollars
alone chink in his sordid mind, and he assiduously plies the trade which
no man would ply who had the talents and industry to procure subsistence
by honourable means.
</p>

<p>
With a bark nearly half filled with fresh eggs they proceed to the
principal rock, that on which they first landed. But what is their surprise
when they find others there helping themselves as industriously as
they can! In boiling rage they charge their guns, and ply their oars.
Landing on the rock, they run up to the Eggers, who, like themselves, are
desperadoes. The first question is a discharge of musketry, the answer
another. Now, man to man, they fight like tigers. One is carried to his
boat with a fractured skull, another limps with a shot in his leg, and a
third feels how many of his teeth have been driven through the hole in
his cheek. At last, however, the quarrel is settled; the booty is to be
equally divided; and now see them all drinking together. Oaths and
curses and filthy jokes are all that you hear; but see, stuffed with food,
and reeling with drink, down they drop one by one; groans and execrations
from the wounded mingle with the snorings of the heavy sleepers.
There let the brutes lie.
</p>

<p>
Again it is dawn, but no one stirs. The sun is high; one by one
they open their heavy eyes, stretch their limbs, yawn, and raise themselves
from the deck. But see, here comes a goodly company. A hundred
honest fishermen, who for months past have fed on salt meat, have felt a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
desire to procure some eggs. Gallantly their boats advance, impelled by
the regular pull of their long oars. Each buoyant bark displays the flag
of its nation. No weapons do they bring, nor any thing that can be used
as such save their oars and fists. Cleanly clad in Sunday attire, they arrive
at the desired spot, and at once prepare to ascend the rock. The
Eggers, now numbering a dozen, all armed with guns and bludgeons, bid
defiance to the fishermen. A few angry words pass between the parties.
One of the Eggers, still under the influence of drink, pulls his trigger, and
an unfortunate sailor is seen to reel in agony. Three loud cheers fill the
air. All at once rush on the malefactors; a horrid fight ensues, the result
of which is, that every Egger is left on the rock beaten and bruised.
Too frequently the fishermen man their boats, row to the shallops, and
break every egg in the hold.
</p>

<p>
The Eggers of Labrador not only rob the birds in this cruel manner,
but also the fishermen, whenever they can find an opportunity; and the
quarrels they excite are numberless. While we were on the coast, none
of our party ever ventured on any of the islands which these wretches
call their own, without being well provided with means of defence. On
one occasion, when I was present, we found two Eggers at their work of
destruction. I spoke to them respecting my visit, and offered them premiums
for rare birds and some of their eggs; but although they made
fair promises, not one of the gang ever came near the Ripley.
</p>

<p>
These people gather all the eider down they can find; yet so inconsiderate
are they, that they kill every bird that comes in their way. The
eggs of Gulls, Guillemots, and Ducks are searched for with care; and the
Puffins and some other birds they massacre in vast numbers for the sake
of their feathers. So constant and persevering are their depredations,
that these species, which, according to the accounts of the few settlers I
saw in the country, were exceedingly abundant twenty years ago, have
abandoned their ancient breeding places, and removed much farther north
in search of peaceful security. Scarcely, in fact, could I procure a young
Guillemot before the Eggers had left the coast, nor was it until late in July
that I succeeded, after the birds had laid three or four eggs each, instead
of one, and when nature having been exhausted, and the season nearly
spent, thousands of these birds left the country without having accomplished
the purpose for which they had visited it. This war of extermination
cannot last many years more. The Eggers themselves will be
the first to repent the entire disappearance of the myriads of birds that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
made the coast of Labrador their summer residence, and unless they
follow the persecuted tribes to the northward, they must renounce their
trade.
</p>

<p>
Had not the British Government long since passed strict laws against
these ruthless and worthless vagabonds, and laid a heavy penalty on all
of them that might be caught in the act of landing their cargoes in Newfoundland
or Nova Scotia, I might—

THE GREAT BLUE HERON.

<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea Herodias</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXI. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
The State of Louisiana has always been my favourite portion of the
Union, although Kentucky and some other States have divided my affections;
but as we are on the banks of the fair Ohio, let us pause a while,
good Reader, and watch the Heron. In my estimation, few of our waders
are more interesting than the birds of this family. Their contours and
movements are always graceful, if not elegant. Look on the one that
stands near the margin of the pure stream:—see his reflection dipping
as it were into the smooth water, the bottom of which it might reach
had it not to contend with the numerous boughs of those magnificent
trees. How calm, how silent, how grand is the scene! The tread of the
tall bird himself no one hears, so carefully does he place his foot on the
moist ground, cautiously suspending it for a while at each step of his progress.
Now his golden eye glances over the surrounding objects, in surveying
which he takes advantage of the full stretch of his graceful neck.
Satisfied that no danger is near, he lays his head on his shoulders, allows
the feathers of his breast to droop, and patiently awaits the approach of
his finned prey. You might imagine what you see to be the statue of a
bird, so motionless is it. But now, he moves; he has taken a silent step,
and with great care he advances; slowly does he raise his head from his
shoulders, and now, what a sudden start! his formidable bill has transfixed
a perch, which he beats to death on the ground. See with what
difficulty he gulps it down his capacious throat! and now his broad wings
open, and away he slowly flies to another station, or perhaps to avoid his
unwelcome observers.
</p>

<p>
The “Blue Crane” (by which name this species is generally known
in the United States) is met with in every part of the Union. Although
more abundant in the low lands of our Atlantic coast, it is not uncommon
in the countries west of the Alleghany Mountains. I have found it
in every State in which I have travelled, as well as in all our “Territories.”
It is well known from Louisiana to Maine, but seldom occurs
farther east than Prince Edward’s Island in the Gulf of St Lawrence,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
and not a Heron of any kind did I see or hear of in Newfoundland or
Labrador. Westward, I believe, it reaches to the very bases of the Rocky
Mountains. It is a hardy bird, and bears the extremes of temperature
surprisingly, being in its tribe what the Passenger Pigeon is in the family
of Doves. During the coldest part of winter the Blue Heron is observed
in the State of Massachusetts and in Maine, spending its time in search
of prey about the warm springs and ponds which occur there in certain
districts. They are not rare in the Middle States, but more plentiful to
the west and south of Pennsylvania, which perhaps arises from the incessant
war waged against them.
</p>

<p>
Extremely suspicious and shy, this bird is ever on the look-out. Its
sight is as acute as that of any falcon, and it can hear at a considerable
distance, so that it is enabled to mark with precision the different objects
it sees, and to judge with accuracy of the sounds which it hears. Unless
under very favourable circumstances, it is almost hopeless to attempt to
approach it. You may now and then surprise one feeding under the
bank of a deep creek or bayou, or obtain a shot as he passes unawares
over you on wing; but to walk up towards one would be a fruitless adventure.
I have seen many so wary, that, on seeing a man at any distance
within half a mile, they would take to wing; and the report of a gun
forces one off his grounds from a distance at which you would think he
could not be alarmed. When in close woods, however, and perched on
a tree, they can be approached with a good chance of success.
</p>

<p>
The Blue Heron feeds at all hours of the day, as well as in the dark
and dawn, and even under night, when the weather is clear, his appetite
alone determining his actions in this respect; but I am certain that when
disturbed during dark nights it feels bewildered, and alights as soon as
possible. When passing from one part of the country to another at a distance,
the case is different, and on such occasions they fly under night at
a considerable height above the trees, continuing their movements in a
regular manner.
</p>

<p>
The commencement of the breeding season varies, according to the
latitude, from the beginning of March to the middle of June. In the Floridas
it takes place about the first of these periods, in the Middle Districts
about the 15th of May, and in Maine a month later. It is at the
approach of this period only that these birds associate in pairs, they being
generally quite solitary at all other times; nay, excepting during the
breeding season, each individual seems to secure for itself a certain district
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
as a feeding ground, giving chase to every intruder of its own species.
At such times they also repose singly, for the most part roosting
on trees, although sometimes taking their station on the ground, in the
midst of a wide marsh, so that they may be secure from the approach of
man. This unsocial temper probably arises from the desire of securing
a certain abundance of food, of which each individual in fact requires a
large quantity.
</p>

<p>
The manners of this Heron are exceedingly interesting at the approach
of the breeding season, when the males begin to look for partners. About
sunrise you see a number arrive and alight either on the margin of a broad
sand-bar or on a savannah. They come from different quarters, one after
another, for several hours; and when you see forty or fifty before you, it
is difficult for you to imagine that half the number could have resided
in the same district. Yet in the Floridas I have seen hundreds thus collected
in the course of a morning. They are now in their full beauty,
and no young birds seem to be among them. The males walk about with
an air of great dignity, bidding defiance to their rivals, and the females
croak to invite the males to pay their addresses to them. The females
utter their coaxing notes all at once, and as each male evinces an equal
desire to please the object of his affection, he has to encounter the enmity
of many an adversary, who, with little attention to politeness, opens his
powerful bill, throws out his wings, and rushes with fury on his foe.
Each attack is carefully guarded against, blows are exchanged for blows;
one would think that a single well-aimed thrust might suffice to inflict
death, but the strokes are parried with as much art as an expert swordsman
would employ; and, although I have watched these birds for half
an hour at a time as they fought on the ground, I never saw one killed
on such an occasion; but I have often seen one felled and trampled upon,
even after incubation had commenced. These combats over, the males
and females leave the place in pairs. They are now mated for the season,
at least I am inclined to think so, as I never saw them assemble
twice on the same ground, and they become comparatively peaceable after
pairing.
</p>

<p>
It is by no means a constant practice with this species to breed in
communities, whether large or small; for although I have seen many
such associations, I have also found many pairs breeding apart. Nor do
they at all times make choice of the trees placed in the interior of a swamp,
for I have found heronries in the pine-barrens of the Floridas, more than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
ten miles from any marsh, pond, or river. I have also observed nests on
the tops of the tallest trees, while others were only a few feet above the
ground: some also I have seen on the ground itself, and many on cactuses.
In the Carolinas, where Herons of all sorts are extremely abundant,
perhaps as much so as in the lower parts of Louisiana or the Floridas,
on account of the numerous reservoirs connected with the rice plantations,
and the still more numerous ditches which intersect the rice-fields,
all of which contain fish of various sorts, these birds find it easy to procure
food in great abundance. There the Blue Herons breed in considerable
numbers, and if the place they have chosen be over a swamp,
few situations can be conceived more likely to ensure their safety, for one
seldom ventures into those dismal retreats at the time when these birds
breed, the effluvia being extremely injurious to health, besides the difficulties
to be overcome in making one’s way to them.
</p>

<p>
Imagine, if you can, an area of some hundred acres, overgrown with
huge cypress trees, the trunks of which, rising to a height of perhaps fifty
feet before they send off a branch, spring from the midst of the dark
muddy waters. Their broad tops, placed close together with interlaced
branches, seem intent on separating the heavens from the earth. Beneath
their dark canopy scarcely a single sunbeam ever makes its way; the
mire is covered with fallen logs, on which grow matted grasses and lichens,
and the deeper parts with nympheæ and other aquatic plants. The
Congo snake and water-moccasin glide before you as they seek to elude
your sight, hundreds of turtles drop, as if shot, from the floating trunks
of the fallen trees, from which also the sullen alligator plunges into the
dismal pool. The air is pregnant with pestilence, but alive with musquitoes
and other insects. The croaking of the frogs, joined with the hoarse
cries of the Anhingas and the screams of the Herons, forms fit music for
such a scene. Standing knee-deep in the mire, you discharge your gun
at one of the numerous birds that are breeding high over head, when immediately
such a deafening noise arises, that, if you have a companion
with you, it were quite useless to speak to him. The frightened birds
cross each other confusedly in their flight; the young attempting to secure
themselves, some of them lose their hold, and fall into the water with
a splash; a shower of leaflets whirls downwards from the tree-tops, and
you are glad to make your retreat from such a place. Should you wish
to shoot Herons, you may stand, fire, and pick up your game as long as
you please; you may obtain several species, too, for not only does the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
Great Blue Heron breed there, but the White, and sometimes the Night
Heron, as well as the Anhinga, and to such places they return year after
year, unless they have been cruelly disturbed.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Blue Heron, in whatever situation it may be placed,
is large and flat, externally composed of dry sticks, and matted with
weeds and mosses to a considerable thickness. When the trees are large
and convenient, you may see several nests on the same tree. The full
complement of eggs which these birds lay is three, and in no instance
have I found more. Indeed, this is constantly the case with all the large
species with which I am acquainted, from <i>Ardea cœrulea</i> to <i>Ardea occidentalis</i>;
but the smaller species lay more as they diminish in size, the
Louisiana Heron having frequently four, and the Green Heron five, and
even sometimes six. Those of the Great Blue Heron are very small
compared with the size of the bird, measuring only two and a half inches
by one and seven-twelfths; they are of a dull bluish-white, without spots,
rather rough, and of a regular oval form.
</p>

<p>
The male and the female sit alternately, receiving food from each
other, their mutual affection being as great as it is towards their young,
which they provide for so abundantly, that it is not uncommon to find
the nest containing a quantity of fish and other food, some fresh, and
some in various stages of putrefaction. As the young advance they are less
frequently fed, although still as copiously supplied whenever opportunity
offers; but now and then I have observed them, when the nests were low,
standing on their haunches, with their legs spread widely before them,
and calling for food in vain. The quantity which they require is now so
great that all the exertions of the old birds appear at times to be insufficient
to satisfy their voracious appetite; and they do not provide for
themselves until fully able to fly, when their parents chase them off, and
force them to shift as they can. They are generally in good condition
when they leave the nest; but from want of experience they find it difficult
to procure as much food as they have been accustomed to, and soon
become poor. Young birds from the nest afford tolerable eating; but the
flesh of the old birds is by no means to my taste, nor so good as some epicures
would have us to believe, and I would at any time prefer that of a
Crow or young Eagle.
</p>

<p>
The principal food of the Great Blue Heron is fish of all kinds; but
it also devours frogs, lizards, snakes, and birds, as well as small quadrupeds,
such as shrews, meadow-mice, and young rats, all of which I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
found in its stomach. Aquatic insects are equally welcome to it, and it
is an expert flycatcher, striking at moths, butterflies, and libellulæ, whether
on the wing or when alighted. It destroys a great number of young
Marsh-Hens, Rails, and other birds; but I never saw one catch a fiddler or
a crab; and the only seeds that I have found in its stomach were those
of the great water-lily of the Southern States. It always strikes its prey
through the body, and as near the head as possible. When the animal is
strong and active, it kills it by beating it against the ground or a rock,
after which it swallows it entire. While on the St John’s River in East
Florida, I shot one of these birds, and on opening it on board, found
in its stomach a fine perch quite fresh, but of which the head had been
cut off. The fish, when cooked, I found excellent, as did Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Piercy</span> and my assistant Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span>, but Mr <span class="smcap">Leehman</span> would not so
much as taste it. When on a visit to my friend <span class="smcap">John Bulow</span>, I was informed
by him, that although he had several times imported gold fishes
from New York, with the view of breeding them in a pond, through
which ran a fine streamlet, and which was surrounded by a wall, they
all disappeared in a few days after they were let loose. Suspecting the
Heron to be the depredator, I desired him to watch the place carefully
with a gun; which was done, and the result was, that he shot a superb
specimen of the present species, in which was found the last gold fish that
remained.
</p>

<p>
In the wild state it never, I believe, eats dead fish of any sort, or indeed
any other food than that killed by itself. Now and then it strikes
at a fish so large and strong as to endanger its own life; and I once saw
one on the Florida coast, that, after striking a fish, when standing in the
water to the full length of its legs, was dragged along for several yards,
now on the surface, and again beneath. When, after a severe struggle,
the Heron disengaged itself, it appeared quite overcome, and stood still
near the shore, his head turned from the sea, as if afraid to try another
such experiment. The number of fishes, measuring five or six inches,
which one of these birds devours in a day, is surprising: Some which I
kept on board the Marion would swallow, in the space of half an hour,
a bucketful of young mullets; and when fed on the flesh of green turtles,
they would eat several pounds at a meal. I have no doubt that, in favourable
circumstances, one of them could devour several hundreds of
small fishes in a day. A Heron that was caught alive on one of the Florida
keys, near Key West, looked so emaciated when it came on board,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
that I had it killed to discover the cause of its miserable condition. It
was an adult female that had bred that spring; her belly was in a state of
mortification, and on opening her, we found the head of a fish measuring
several inches, which, in an undigested state, had lodged among the entrails
of the poor bird. How long it had suffered could only be guessed,
but this undoubtedly was the cause of the miserable state in which it was
found.
</p>

<p>
I took a pair of young Herons of this species to Charleston. They
were nearly able to fly when caught, and were standing erect a few yards
from the nest, in which lay a putrid one that seemed to have been trampled
to death by the rest. They offered little resistance, but grunted
with a rough uncouth voice. I had them placed in a large coop, containing
four individuals of the <i>Ardea occidentalis</i>, who immediately attacked
the new-comers in the most violent manner, so that I was obliged to turn
them loose on the deck. I had frequently observed the great antipathy
evinced by the majestic white species towards the blue in the wild state,
but was surprised to find it equally strong in young birds which had
never seen one, and were at that period smaller than the others. All
my endeavours to remove their dislike were unavailing, for when placed
in a large yard, the White Herons attacked the Blue, and kept them completely
under. The latter became much tamer, and were more attached
to each other. Whenever a piece of turtle was thrown to them, it was
dexterously caught in the air and gobbled up in an instant, and as they
became more familiar, they ate bits of biscuit, cheese, and even rhinds of
bacon.
</p>

<p>
When wounded, the Great Blue Heron immediately prepares for defence,
and woe to the man or dog who incautiously comes within reach
of its powerful bill, for that instant he is sure to receive a severe wound,
and the risk is so much the greater that birds of this species commonly
aim at the eye. If beaten with a pole or long stick, they throw themselves
on their back, cry aloud, and strike with their bill and claws with great
force. I have shot some on trees, which, although quite dead, clung by
their claws for a considerable time before they fell. I have also seen the
Blue Heron giving chase to a Fish Hawk, whilst the latter was pursuing
its way through the air towards a place where it could feed on the fish
which it bore in its talons. The Heron soon overtook the Hawk, and at
the very first lounge made by it, the latter dropped its quarry, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
Heron sailed slowly towards the ground, where it no doubt found the
fish. On one occasion of this kind, the Hawk dropped the fish in the
water, when the Heron, as if vexed that it was lost to him, continued to
harass the Hawk, and forced it into the woods.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Great Blue Heron is even, powerful, and capable of
being protracted to a great distance. On rising from the ground or on
leaving its perch, it goes off in silence with extended neck and dangling
legs, for eight or ten yards, after which it draws back its neck, extends
its feet in a straight line behind, and with easy and measured flappings
continues its course, at times flying low over the marshes, and again, as if
suspecting danger, at a considerable height over the land or the forest.
It removes from one pond or creek, or even from one marsh to another,
in a direct manner, deviating only on apprehending danger. When about
to alight, it now and then sails in a circular direction, and when near the
spot it extends its legs, and keeps its wings stretched out until it has effected
a footing. The same method is employed when it alights on a
tree, where, however, it does not appear to be as much at its ease as on the
ground. When suddenly surprised by an enemy, it utters several loud
discordant notes, and mutes the moment it flies off.
</p>

<p>
This species takes three years in attaining maturity, and even after
that period it still increases in size and weight. When just hatched they
have a very uncouth appearance, the legs and neck being very long, as
well as the bill. By the end of a-week the head and neck are sparingly
covered with long tufts of silky down, of a dark grey colour, and the
body exhibits young feathers, the quills large with soft blue sheaths.
The tibio-tarsal joints appear monstrous, and at this period the bones of
the leg are so soft, that one may bend them to a considerable extent without
breaking them. At the end of four weeks, the body and wings are
well covered with feathers of a dark slate colour, broadly margined with
ferruginous, the latter colour shewing plainly on the thighs and the flexure
of the wing; the bill has grown wonderfully, the legs would not now easily
break, and the birds are able to stand erect on the nest or on the objects
near it. They are now seldom fed oftener than once a-day, as if their
parents were intent on teaching them that abstinence without which it
would often be difficult for them to subsist in their after life. At the
age of six or seven weeks they fly off, and at once go in search of food,
each by itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In the following spring, at which time they have grown much, the
elongated feathers of the breast and shoulders are seen, the males shew
the commencement of the pendent crest, and the top of the head has become
white. None breed at this age, in so far as I have been able to observe.
The second spring, they have a handsome appearance, the upper
parts have become light, the black and white marks are much purer,
and some have the crest three or four inches in length. Some breed
at this age. The third spring, the Great Blue Heron is as represented
in the plate.
</p>

<p>
The males are somewhat larger than the females, but there is very
little difference between the sexes in external appearance. This species
moults in the Southern States about the beginning of May, or as soon as
the young are hatched, and one month after the pendent crest is dropped,
and much of the beauty of the bird is gone for the season. The weight
of a full grown Heron of this kind, when it is in good condition, is about
eight pounds; but this varies very much according to circumstances, and
I have found some having all the appearance of old birds that did not
exceed six pounds. The stomach consists of a long bag, thinly covered
by a muscular coat, and is capable of containing several fishes at a time.
The intestine is not thicker than the quill of a swan, and measures from
eight and a half to nine feet in length.

On Prince Edward’s Island, in the Gulf of St Lawrence, there is
a fine breeding-place of the Great Blue Heron, which is probably the
most northern on the Atlantic coast of North America. The birds there
are more shy than they usually are at the period of breeding, and in the
most cowardly manner abandon their young to the mercy of every intruder.
A friend of mine who visited this place for the purpose of procuring
adult birds in their best plumage, to add to his already extensive
collection, found it extremely difficult to obtain his object, until he at
length thought of covering himself with the hide of an ox, under the disguise
of which he readily got within shot of the birds, which were completely
deceived by the stratagem.

<h2>
THE COMMON AMERICAN GULL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Larus zonorhynchus</i>, Richardson.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXII. Adult Male, and Young in winter.</span>
</p>

<p>
No country can afford greater facilities for the migration of water-birds
than the United States of America. Even the Gulls are enabled to
traverse their whole extent from north to south, and in the contrary direction,
without suffering from want of food or of proper resting places.
The Gull that has been bred in Labrador, or still farther north, can reach
the Gulf of Mexico without being seriously incommoded by the storms that
now and then rage along the Atlantic coast. The broad waters of the St
Lawrence leads it to our great lakes, from which hundreds of streams
conduct it to the head waters of the Ohio or the Mississippi, by following
the windings of which it at length arrives in the warm regions of the
Mexican Gulf, on whose waters the traveller can spend the winter. That
these advantages are embraced by many species of Gull, there can be no
doubt; and should you, as I have done, repeatedly visit our broad lakes,
or the great rivers just mentioned, you would find there, at particular
seasons, not only this species, but several others, as well as various kinds
of Terns, but none of the genus Lestris. Lake Erie supplies with food
the <i>Larus marinus</i>, <i>L. argentatus</i>, <i>L. atricilla</i>, and some others, as
well as the Great, the Arctic, the Roseate, and the Black Terns, all of
which pass at times over to the Ohio, and from thence to the ocean.
During these inland movements, the birds seem to be peculiarly attracted
by certain places, at which they remain for a while. Thus, at the
Falls of the Ohio, some species remain for weeks, and wherever much
shipping occurs on that river or the Mississippi, Gulls are sure to be seen
gleaning the garbage that has been thrown overboard, or seizing such
fishes as rise incautiously to the surface of the water. In the months of
September and October, Gulls and Terns might almost be said to abound
on our great streams, and many return thither during the spring months
on their way northward. Nay, to some species of Tern, the beautiful
sand-bars and rocky beaches that occur here and there, are so attractive as
to induce a few to remain and breed there. This is especially the case
with the Black Terns, some of which rear their young by the rapids of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
the Ohio below Louisville, amidst the roaring sounds of which may be
heard their shrill and continued cries.
</p>

<p>
You must not suppose, however, that all the Gulls which migrate in
that country take the same route; for thousands follow the sinuosities of
our Atlantic coast, some of them perhaps proceeding as far south in that
direction as those which follow our rivers. My opinion is, that the feebler
individuals of the different species follow the inland route, while the older
and more hardy birds keep along the shores of the ocean. The examination
of numerous specimens on both of these extensive tracks has almost
rendered this a matter of certainty, yet I should be much pleased to find
this opinion corroborated by the observations of any other student of
nature.
</p>

<p>
While on the coast of Florida, in the winter of 1832-33, I every day
saw Gulls of many species, but among them all were no adult birds, with
the exception of the Black-headed Gull of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, which was very
abundant. This greatly tended to strengthen my opinion, that the young
gulls are of more delicate constitution than their parents, which are better
enabled to stand the rigours of the winter in the Middle States, where
they are found equally abundant at that season. For similar reasons, I
also feel assured that the oldest birds are those which go farthest north to
breed, and that the older and stronger individuals are larger, with more
purely tinted plumage, and with the colours of their legs, feet and bills,
as well as of the circle around the eye, more vivid, than those which, although
found breeding, yet have not acquired their full maturity. In
consequence of these circumstances, some species have been described as
forming several, and the great difference between the plumage of the young
and the old birds has led to similar errors.
</p>

<p>
Our Common Gull is seldom seen in the adult plumage of winter beyond
the shores of Maryland southward, or in full summer plumage beyond
the Bay of New York, and this rarely after the middle of April,
as at that period they gather into flocks, and remove farther north to
breed. The places to which this species resorts for that purpose, and
which I have visited, are several islands between Boston and Eastport,
another close to Grand Manan at the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, the
great Gannet Rock of the Gulf of St Lawrence, and certain rocky isles
in the deep bays on the coast of Labrador.
</p>

<p>
This species, although one of those most abundant on our coast, is so
well acquainted with the artifices of man, that it keeps more than others
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
beyond the reach of the gun. While in our harbours or rivers it sails at
a moderate height, sometimes mingling with the Silvery Gull, or even
with the Great Black-backed. Its movements are graceful and easy, and
it floats as it were in the air, whether proceeding in a direct line, or in
irregular curves, when, suddenly checking its speed, it partially closes its
wings, and descends with rapidity in a spiral manner. As it approaches
the water, it allows its legs to hang, opens its bill, and while seizing its
food, raises its wings erect and flaps them quickly to support its body.
Now with loaded bill it sweeps off to some distance, alights, and devours
its prey.
</p>

<p>
When in pursuit of a shoal of small fish, it assembles in flocks, keeps
up a constant yelping noise, dips every instant among the fry, and continues
to feed until so gorged as to be unable to fly. Alighting in groups,
they float with great buoyancy, and it is pleasant to see them rising and
falling alternately on the waves of a moderately agitated sea, the snowy
whiteness of their under parts contrasting with the deep green water, and
their elongated wings extending beyond the tail, giving the appearance
of lightness and agility to their form.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is light and long sustained, and the circumstance
of birds of this genus being able to find food almost anywhere, induces
them at times to proceed far out to sea; and I have now and then
been gratified by the sudden appearance of several birds of the present
species to the lee of the ship, on whose deck I was with impatience
watching for the sight of land. The winged pilgrims would no sooner
come up than they also would express their pleasure by their cries, especially
when they received from the passengers bits of bread or such garbage
as might be at hand. Once fed, they would fly about us the whole
day, and sometimes would be seen the next; and then perhaps all at
once, as if made aware of the existence of land in a particular direction,
they would fly off, and we would see no more of them.
</p>

<p>
When spring has fairly commenced, our Common Gulls assemble in
parties of hundreds, and alight on mud flats or sandy beaches, in our
eastern estuaries and bays. For a while they regularly resort to these
places, which to the Gulls are what the scratching or tooting grounds are
to the Pinnated Grous. The male Gulls, however, although somewhat pugnacious,
are not very inveterate in their quarrels, making up by clamour
for the deficiency of prowess in their tournaments. The males bow to
the females with swollen throats, and walk round them with many odd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
gesticulations. As soon as the birds are paired, they give up their animosities,
and for the rest of the season live together on the best terms.
After a few weeks spent in these preparatory pleasures, the flocks take to
wing, and betake themselves to their breeding places.
</p>

<p>
On an island within a few miles of Eastport in Maine, I found these
birds breeding in great numbers in the beginning of May. Their nests
were there placed amid the scanty tufts of grass. On the Gannet Rock,
early in June, they were breeding on the shelves towards the summit,
along with the Guillemots, while the Kittiwakes had secured their nests
far below. The different species kept apart, but yet exhibited no antipathy
towards each other. On the 18th of July, we discovered a low
rocky island at the bottom of a bay ten miles from the open sea, opposite
the harbour of Little Macatina, on the coast of Labrador, where we found
upwards of two hundred nests, all containing eggs with the chicks more
or less advanced. The number of eggs in each nest was three or four,
more generally three. They resembled those of the Great Black-backed
Gull in form and colour, but were much smaller, measuring two inches
and three quarters in length, by one and five and a half eighths in their
greatest diameter. There was considerable diversity both in the tint
of their ground colour, and in the number and size of the spots on
them, as is the case with the eggs of most water birds. In general,
however, they were of a dull dark cream-colour, thickly blotched, sprinkled
and touched with different shades of purple, umber, and black. When
fresh, these eggs are delicious food, as I have had abundant occasion
to know. The nests were in this place all situated on the bare rock,
but in all other respects resembled those found among the grass or on
more elevated rocks; they were formed of seaweeds, well constructed,
about six inches across within, and twelve in their greatest diameter.
Some of the nests were much thicker and larger than others;
many were placed within the distance of a foot from each other; and the
whole place was covered with feathers and dung, which emitted a very
disagreeable stench, proving to us that it was annually resorted to by
these birds. To our surprise the birds were very shy. Among those
killed by us were some having all the appearance of mature age, such as
I have mentioned above. The number of individuals among them having
the black ring on the bill was much greater than among those found
near Grand Manan; some, however, were without this ring, and on
others it was but partially marked. Some had no white on the tips of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
primaries, and differences were also observable in the length of the tarsus
and toes; but all had the same voice, and were actually of the same species.
We also found considerable differences in their size and weight,
even in individuals of the same sex, some weighing one pound, others four
ounces more, and some so much as one pound ten ounces. The males,
at an average, were larger than the females. Not a bird of any other
species was found there, or on the grassy islands.
</p>

<p>
Whatever opinion may be held as to the synonyms of this Gull, I am
perfectly assured of the above mentioned variations in the colour, size,
and markings of the younger and older birds. I am equally sure that no
individuals acquire the full beauty of their plumage before the third
spring. The young are at first of a dull greenish-yellow, spotted with
dark brown on the head and rump. In a very few days they leave the
nest, ramble about in its vicinity, waiting the arrival of their parents with
food, and conceal themselves under stones or in crevices at the appearance
of danger. When a few weeks old, they do not hesitate, on being pursued,
to betake themselves to the water, where they swim with great
lightness. When about the size of pigeons, they assume a brownish colour,
each feather being broadly banded or tipped with light ferruginous
and grey. At this season, the fishermen of Labrador and Newfoundland
kill them in great numbers, and pack them in salt for winter use. I was
much surprised one morning while at Labrador, to see one of the barges
of the Gulnare come alongside of the Ripley after a long cruize, when officers
and men were glad to have a good mess of these young Gulls in the
bow of their boat, they having run short of provisions.

On a rocky island on the coast of Labrador, where this bird was
breeding in great numbers, a comparatively small number of individuals
only had the bill marked with the black ring, the others, although precisely
similar in other respects, wanted that mark. This bird although
in many respects precisely similar to that which is usually named <i>Larus
canus</i> in Europe, differs greatly in the size of the bill, which even in
young birds is much deeper than in the oldest individuals of that species.

</p>

<p>
The Sea Parrot, as this bird is usually called on the eastern coasts
of the United States, as well as by the fishermen of Newfoundland and
Labrador, sometimes proceeds as far south as the entrance of the River
Savannah in Georgia, where I saw a good number in the winter of
1831-32. It is by no means, however, common with this species to
extend its southward migrations so far, and I suspect it does so only
in very severe weather. It is never plentiful off Long Island, but becomes
more abundant the farther you proceed eastward, until you reach
the entrance to the Bay of Fundy, where it is quite common, and on the
Islands of which many breed, although not one perhaps now for a hundred
that bred there twenty years ago. Those which proceed farther north
leave the United States about the middle of April, and move along the
coast, none ever crossing over the land to any extent. On my voyage
to Labrador I observed Puffins every day; but although we reached
that country in the early part of June, none had then begun to breed.
As we approached the shores of that inhospitable land, we every now
and then saw them around the vessel, now floating on the swelling wave,
now disappearing under the bow, diving with the swiftness of thought,
and sometimes rising on wing and flying swiftly, but low, over the sea.
The nearer we approached the coast the more abundant did we find the
Puffins, and sometimes they were so numerous as actually to cover the
water to the extent of half an acre or more. At first we paid little attention
to them, but as soon as I became aware that they had begun to breed,
I commenced an investigation, of which I now proceed to lay before you
the result.
</p>

<p>
The first breeding place which I and my party visited was a small
island, a few acres in extent, and pleasant to the eye, on account of the
thick growth of green grass with which it was covered. The shores were
exceedingly rugged, the sea ran high, and it required all the good management
of our captain to effect a safe landing, which, however, was at
length accomplished at a propitious moment, when, borne on the summit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
of a great wave, we reached the first rocks, leaped out in an instant, and
held our boat, while the angry waters rolled back and left it on the land.
After securing the boat, we reached with a few steps the green sward,
and directly before us found abundance of Puffins. Some already alarmed
flew past us with the speed of an arrow, others stood erect at the entrance
of their burrows, while some more timid withdrew within their holes as
we advanced towards them. In the course of half an hour we obtained a
good number. The poor things seemed not at all aware of the effect of
guns, for they would fly straight towards us as often as in any other direction;
but after a while they became more knowing, and avoided us
with more care. We procured some eggs, and as no young ones were yet
to be found, we went off satisfied. The soil was so light, and so easily
dug, that many of the burrows extended to the depth of five or six feet,
although not more than a few inches below the surface, and some of the
poor birds underwent a temporary imprisonment in consequence of the
ground giving way under our weight. The whole island was perforated
like a rabbit-warren, and every hole had its entrance placed due south, a
circumstance which allowed the birds to emerge in our sight almost all at
once, presenting a spectacle highly gratifying to us all. Our visit to this
island took place on the 28th of June 1833.
</p>

<p>
On the 12th of August, the day after my son procured the two Jerfalcons
mentioned in the second volume of this work, our Captain, my
friends <span class="smcap">George Shattuck</span> and <span class="smcap">William Ingalls</span>, with four sailors,
and another boat in company, went on a visit to “Perroket Island,” distant
about two miles from the harbour of Bras d’Or. The place is known
to all the cod-fishers, and is celebrated for the number of Puffins that annually
breed there. As we rowed towards it, although we found the water
literally covered with thousands of these birds, the number that flew over
and around the green island seemed much greater, insomuch that one might
have imagined half the Puffins in the world had assembled there. This far-famed
isle is of considerable extent, its shores are guarded by numberless
blocks of rock, and within a few yards of it the water is several fathoms in
depth. The ground rises in the form of an amphitheatre to the height of
about seventy feet, the greatest length being from north to south, and its
southern extremity fronting the Streight of Belleisle. For every burrow in
the island previously visited by us there seemed to be a hundred here, on
every crag or stone stood a Puffin, at the entrance of each hole another,
and yet the sea was covered and the air filled by them. I had two double-barrelled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
guns and two sailors to assist me; and I shot for one hour by
my watch, always firing at a single bird on wing. How many Puffins I
killed in that time I take the liberty of leaving you to guess.
</p>

<p>
The burrows were all inhabited by young birds, of different ages and
sizes, and clouds of Puffins flew over our heads, each individual holding
a “lint” by the head. This fish, which measures four or five inches in
length, and is of a very slender form, with a beautiful silvery hue, existed
in vast shoals in the deep water around the island. The speed with
which the birds flew made the fish incline by the side of their neck.
While flying the Puffins emitted a loud croaking noise, but they never
dropped the fish, and many of them, when brought down by a shot, still
held their prey fast. I observed with concern the extraordinary affection
manifested by these birds towards each other; for whenever one fell dead
or wounded on the water, its mate or a stranger immediately alighted by
its side, swam round it, pushed it with its bill as if to urge it to fly or
dive, and seldom would leave it until an oar was raised to knock it on
the head, when at last, aware of the danger, it would plunge below in an
instant. Those which fell wounded immediately ran with speed to some
hole, and dived into it, on which no further effort was made to secure
them. Those which happened to be caught alive in the hand bit most
severely, and scratched with their claws at such a rate that we were
glad to let them escape. The burrows here communicated in various
ways with each other, so that the whole island was perforated as if by
a multitude of subterranean labyrinths, over which one could not run
without the risk of falling at almost every step. The voices of the young
sounded beneath our feet like voices from the grave, and the stench was
extremely disagreeable, so that as soon as our boats were filled with birds
we were glad to get away.
</p>

<p>
During the whole of our visit, the birds never left the place, but constantly
attended to their avocations. Here one would rise from beneath
our feet, there, within a few yards of us, another would alight with a fish,
and dive into its burrow, or feed the young that stood waiting at the entrance.
The young birds were far from being friendly towards each
other, and those which we carried with us kept continually fighting so
long as we kept them alive. They used their yet extremely small and
slender bills with great courage and pertinacity, and their cries resembled
the wailings of young whelps. The smaller individuals were fed by the
parents by regurgitation, or received little pieces of fish which were placed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
in their mouths; the larger picked up the fish that were dropped before
them; but almost all of them seemed to crawl to the entrance of the holes
for the purpose of being fed. In all the burrows that communicated with
others, a round place was scooped out on one side of the avenue, in the
form of an oven; while in those which were single, this oven-like place
was found at the end, and was larger than the corridor. All the passages
were flattish above, and rounded beneath, as well as on the sides. In
many instances we found two birds sitting each on its egg in the same
hole.
</p>

<p>
The Puffin never lays more than one egg, unless the first may have
been destroyed or taken away; nor does it raise more than a single young
one in the season. The time of incubation is probably from twenty-five to
twenty-eight days, although I have not been able to ascertain the precise
period. Both birds work in digging the hole, using their bills and feet;
they also sit alternately on their egg, although the female engages more
industriously in this occupation, while the male labours harder at the
burrow. The egg is pure white when first deposited, but soon becomes
soiled by the earth, as no nest is formed for its reception. It generally
measures two and a half inches by one and three-fourths, but varies in
size according to the age of the bird, as well as in shape, some being considerably
more rounded at the smaller end than others. When boiled, the
white is of a livid-blue colour. The captain and myself were the only
persons of our party who tried to eat some. The eggs are certainly very
bad, and are never collected by “The Eggers.” The flesh of the birds
is very dark, tough, and so fishy, as to be eatable only in cases of great
want. Two Italians who had come to Labrador to purchase cod-fish, and
were short of provisions, fed upon Puffins daily, to the great amusement
of our party. The fishermen at times, when bait is scarce along the coast,
destroy a great number of these birds, which they skin like rabbits, and
then cut the flesh into slices.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Puffin is firm, generally direct, now and then pretty
well sustained. It is able to rise at once from the water or the land, although
at times it runs on both before taking to wing. This depends
much on necessity, for if pushed it flies at once from the ground, or
plunges under the surface of the water. There they swim, with the wings
partially opened, at a small depth, passing along in the manner of Divers;
and by this means they catch their prey; but at other times they dive to
the bottom, many fathoms deep, for shell-fish and other objects.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
</p>

<p>
During the love season, the males chase each other in the air, on the
water, or beneath its surface, with so much quickness, as to resemble the
ricochets of a cannon-ball. Having kept several for about a week, I
threw them overboard in the harbour where we were at anchor, and where
the water was beautifully clear. On leaving my gloved hand, they
plunged through the air, entered the water, and swam off, assisting themselves
by their wings to the distance of from fifty to an hundred yards.
On coming up, they washed their plumage for a long time, and then dived
in search of food. While on board, they ran about from the dark towards
the light, keeping themselves erect, and moving with great briskness, until
at times close to my feet, when they would watch my motions like
hawks, and if I happened to look towards them, would instantly make
for some hiding-place. They fed freely and were agreeable pets, only
that they emitted an unpleasant grunting noise, and ran about incessantly
during the night, when each footstep could be counted. When on rocky
shores, or islands with large stones, I observed that the Puffins often flew
from one crag or stone to another, alighting with ease, and then standing
erect.
</p>

<p>
The young, while yet covered with down, are black, with a white patch
on the belly. Their bills do not acquire much of the form which they
ultimately have for several weeks; nor do they assume their perfect shape
for years. I have examined many hundred individuals, among which I
have found great differences in the size and form of the bill. In fact, the
existence of this diversity has induced many persons to think that we have
several species of Puffin on our coasts; but, after having examined many
specimens in Europe, I am decidedly of opinion that this species is the
same that occurs in both continents, and that we have only one more at
all common on our eastern coasts. The sexes differ in no perceptible degree,
only that the males are somewhat larger. When two years old they
may be considered of their full size, although the bill continues to grow
and acquires furrows, until it becomes as you see it in the Plate.

A few birds of this species occasionally go as far south as New York
during winter; but beyond that parallel I never met with one. From Boston
eastward many are seen, and some breed on the Seal Islands off the
entrance of the Bay of Fundy. These Auks generally arrive on our Atlantic
coast about the beginning of November, and return northward to
breed about the middle of April. During their stay with us, they are
generally seen singly, and at a greater distance from the shores than the
Guillemots or Puffins; and I have no doubt that they are able to procure
shell-fish at greater depths than these birds. I have observed them fishing
on banks where the bottom was fifteen or eighteen fathoms from the
surface, and, from the length of time that they remained under water,
felt no doubt that they dived to it. On my voyage round Nova Scotia
and across the Gulf of St Lawrence, we saw some of them constantly.
Some had eggs on the Magdeleine Islands, where, as the inhabitants informed
us, these birds arrive about the middle of April, when the Gulf
is still covered with ice. As we proceeded towards Labrador, they passed
us every now and then in long files, flying at the height of a few yards
from the water, in a rather undulating manner, with a constant beat of
the wings, often within musket-shot of our vessel, and sometimes moving
round us and coming so close as to induce us to believe that they had
a wish to alight. The thermometer indicated 44°. The sight of these
files of birds passing swiftly by was extremely pleasing; each bird would
alternately turn towards us the pure white of its lower parts, and again
the jetty black of the upper. As I expected ere many days should pass
to have the gratification of inspecting their breeding grounds, I experienced
great delight in observing them as they sped their flight toward
the north.
</p>

<p>
After we had landed, we every day procured Auks, notwithstanding
their shyness, which exceeded that of almost all the other sea-birds. The
fishermen having given me an account of their principal breeding places,
the Ripley proceeded toward them apace. One fair afternoon we came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
in view of the renowned Harbour of Whapati Guan, and already saw its
curious beacon, which, being in form like a huge mounted cannon placed
on the elevated crest of a great rock, produced a most striking effect. We
knew that the harbour was within the stupendous wall of rock before us,
but our pilot, either from fear or want of knowledge, refused to guide us
to it, and our captain, leaving the vessel in charge of the mate, was obliged
to go off in a boat, to see if he could find a passage. He was absent more
than an hour. The Ripley stood off and on, the yards were manned on
the look-out, the sea was smooth and its waters as clear as crystal, but
the swell rose to a prodigious height as it passed sluggishly over the great
rocks that seemed to line the shallows over which we floated. We were
under no apprehension of personal danger, however, for we had several
boats and a very efficient crew; and besides, the shores were within cannon
shot; but the idea of losing our gallant bark and all our materials
on so dismal a coast haunted my mind, and at times those of my companions.
From the tops our sailors called out “Quite shallow here, Sir.”
Up went the helm, and round swung the Ripley like a duck taken by
surprise. Then suddenly near another shoal we passed, and were careful
to keep a sharp look-out until our commander came up.
</p>

<p>
Springing upon the deck, and turning his quid rapidly from side to side,
he called out, “All hands square the yards,” and whispered to me “All’s
safe, my good Sir.” The schooner advanced towards the huge barrier,
merrily as a fair maiden to meet her beloved; now she doubles a sharp
cape, forces her way through a narrow pass; and lo! before you opens
the noble harbour of Whapati Guan. All around was calm and solemn;
the waters were smooth as glass, the sails fell against the masts, but the
impetus which the vessel had received urged her along. The lead was
heaved at every yard, and in a few minutes the anchor was dropped.
</p>

<p>
Reader, I wish you had been there, that you might yourself describe
the wild scene that presented itself to our admiring gaze. We were separated
from the rolling swell of the Gulf of St Lawrence by an immense
wall of rock. Far away toward the east and north, rugged mounds
innumerable rose one above another. Multitudes of frightened Cormorants
croaked loudly as they passed us in the air, and at a distance
fled divers Guillemots and Auks. The mossy beds around us shone with
a brilliant verdure, the lark piped its sweet notes on high, and thousands
of young codfish leaped along the surface of the deep cove as if with joy.
Such a harbour I had never seen before; such another, it is probable, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
may never see again; the noblest fleet that ever ploughed the ocean might
anchor in it in safety. To augment our pleasures, our captain some days
after piloted the Gulnare into it. But, you will say, “Where are the
Auks, we have lost sight of them entirely.” Never fear, good reader, we
are in a delightful harbour, and anon you shall hear of them.
</p>

<p>
Winding up the basin toward the north-east, Captain Emery, myself,
and some sailors, all well armed, proceeded one day along the high and
precipitous shores to the distance of about four miles, and at last reached
the desired spot. We landed on a small rugged island. Our men were
provided with long poles, having hooks at their extremities. These sticks
were introduced into the deep and narrow fissures, from which we carefully
drew the birds and eggs. One place, in particular, was full of birds;
it was a horizontal fissure, about two feet in height, and thirty or forty
yards in depth. We crawled slowly into it, and as the birds affrighted
flew hurriedly past us by hundreds, many of their eggs were smashed.
The farther we advanced, the more dismal did the cries of the birds sound
in our ears. Many of them, despairing of effecting their escape, crept
into the surrounding recesses. Having collected as many of them and
their eggs as we could, we returned, and glad were we once more to
breathe the fresh air. No sooner were we out than the cracks of the
sailors’ guns echoed among the rocks. Rare fun to the tars, in fact, was
every such trip, and, when we joined them, they had a pile of Auks on
the rocks near them. The birds flew directly towards the muzzles of the
guns, as readily as in any other course, and therefore it needed little
dexterity to shoot them.
</p>

<p>
When the Auks deposit their eggs along with the Guillemots, which
they sometimes do, they drop them in spots from which the water can
escape without injuring them; but when they breed in deep fissures,
which is more frequently the case, many of them lie close together,
and the eggs are deposited on small beds of pebbles or broken stones
raised a couple of inches or more, to let the water pass beneath them.
Call this instinct if you will:—I really do not much care; but you must
permit me to admire the wonderful arrangements of that Nature from
which they have received so much useful knowledge. When they lay
their eggs in such a horizontal cavern as that which I have mentioned
above, you find them scattered at the distance of a few inches from each
other; and there, as well as in the fissures, they sit flat upon them like
Ducks, for example, whereas on an exposed rock, each bird stands almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
upright upon its egg. Another thing quite as curious, which I observed,
is, that, while in exposed situations, the Auk seldom lays more than one
egg, yet in places of greater security I have, in many instances, found
two under a single bird. This may perhaps astonish you, but I really
cannot help it.
</p>

<p>
The Razor-billed Auks begin to drop their eggs in the beginning of
May. In July we found numerous young ones, although yet small.
Their bill then scarcely exhibited the form which it ultimately assumes.
They were covered with down, had a lisping note, but fed freely on
shrimps and small bits of fish, the food with which their parents supply
them. They were very friendly towards each other, differing greatly in
this respect from the young Puffins, which were continually quarrelling.
They stood almost upright. Whenever a finger was placed within their
reach, they instantly seized it, and already evinced the desire to bite severely
so cordially manifested by the old birds of this species, which in
fact will hang to your hand until choked rather than let go their hold.
The latter when wounded threw themselves on their back, in the manner
of Hawks, and scratched fiercely with their claws. They walked and
ran on the rocks with considerable ease and celerity, taking to wing, however,
as soon as possible. When thus disturbed while breeding, they fly
round the spot many times before they alight again. Sometimes a whole
flock will alight on the water at some distance, to watch your departure,
before they will venture to return.
</p>

<p>
This bird lays one or two eggs, according to the nature of the place.
The eggs measure at an average three inches and one-eighth, by two and
one-eighth, and are generally pure white, greatly blotched with dark reddish-brown
or black, the spots generally forming a circle towards the larger
end. They differ considerably from those of the Common and the
Thick-billed Guillemots, being less blunted at the smaller end. The eggs
afford excellent eating; the yolk is of a pale orange colour, the white
pale blue. The eggers collect but few of the eggs of this bird, they being
more difficult to be obtained than those of the Guillemot, of which
they take vast numbers every season.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Razor-billed Auk consists of shrimps, various other
marine animals, and small fishes, as well as roe. Their flesh is by the
fishers considered good, and I found it tolerable, when well stewed, although
it is dark and therefore not prepossessing. The birds are two
years in acquiring the full size and form of their bill, and, when full
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
grown, they weighed about a pound and a half. The stomach is an oblong
sac, the lower part of which is rather muscular, and answers the purpose
of a gizzard. In many I found scales, remnants of fish, and pieces
of shells. The intestines were upwards of three feet in length.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the breeding season, these birds drop their quills,
and are quite unable to fly until the beginning of October, when they
all leave their breeding grounds for the sea, and move southward. The
young at this period scarcely shew the white streak between the bill and
the eye; their cheeks, like those of the old birds at this time, and the
fore part of the neck, are dingy white, and remain so until the following
spring, when the only difference between the young and the old is, that
the former have the bill smaller and less furrowed, and the head more
brown. The back, tail, and lower parts do not seem to undergo any
material change.

<h2>
HYPERBOREAN PHALAROPE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Phalaropus hyperboreus</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXV. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
Few individuals of this species are ever seen to the South of New York.
Near Boston I procured several, and my learned friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>
presented me with some that had been shot in the neighbourhood
of that city, as did Mr <span class="smcap">John Bethune</span> and Mr <span class="smcap">Rodman</span> of New Bedford.
As we advanced eastward in the month of May, we saw more and
more of them, and while at Eastport in Maine my son John shot several
out of flocks of sixty or more. At one time a flock consisting of
more than a hundred was seen in the Bay of Fundy. They were exceedingly
shy, and the gunners of Eastport, who knew them under the
name of Sea Geese, spoke of them as very curious birds.
</p>

<p>
They procure their food principally upon the water, on which they
alight like Ducks, float as light as Gulls, and move about in search of food
with much nimbleness. The sight of a bank of floating sea-weeds or
garbage of any kind induces them at once to alight upon it, when they
walk about as unconcernedly as if on land. Their notes, which resemble
the syllables <i>tweet, tweet, tweet</i>, are sharp and clear, and in their flight
they resemble our common American Snipe. At the approach of an
enemy, they immediately close their ranks, until they almost touch each
other, when great havock is made among them; but if not immediately
shot at, they rise all at once and fly swiftly off emitting their shrill cries,
and remove to a great distance. These Phalaropes congregate in this
manner for the purpose of moving northwards to their breeding grounds,
although some remain and breed as far south as Mount Desert Island.
I have met with them in equally large flocks at a distance of more than
a hundred miles from the shores. They were feeding on great beds of
floating seaweeds, and in several instances some Red Phalaropes were
seen in their company.
</p>

<p>
Whilst in Labrador, I observed that the Hyperborean Phalarope occurred
only in small parties of a few pairs, and that instead of keeping at
sea or on the salt-water bays, they were always in the immediate vicinity
of small fresh-water lakes or ponds, near which they bred. The nest was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
a hollow scooped out among the herbage, and covered with a few bits
of dried grass and moss. The eggs are always four; they measure at an
average an inch and three-sixteenths in length, seven-eighths in their greatest
diameter, are rather pointed at the smaller end, and are more uniform
in their size and markings than those of most water-birds. The
ground colour is a deep dull buff, and is irregularly marked with large
and small blotches of dark reddish-brown, which are larger and more
abundant on the crown. The birds shewed great anxiety for the safety
of their eggs, limping before us, or running with extended wings, and
emitting a feeble melancholy note as if about to expire. When we approached
them, they resumed all their natural alacrity, piped in their
usual manner, flew off and alighted on the water. Captain Emery and
myself followed some nearly an hour, assisted by a pointer dog, in the hope
of tiring them out; but they seemed to laugh at our efforts, and when Dash
was quite close to them, they would suddenly fly off in another direction,
and with great swiftness, always leading us farther from their nests. The
young leave the nest shortly after they are hatched, and run after their
parents over the moss, and along the edges of the small ponds; but I
saw none on the water that were not fully fledged. Both young and old
had departed by the beginning of August.
</p>

<p>
The Hyperborean Phalarope seems to undergo an almost continual
moult, and is in full plumage only about six weeks each year. The
young when fledged are nearly grey above, and all white beneath. Some of
them breed before they have acquired what may be considered the perfect
plumage; and the very old birds become greyish also at the approach
of winter, the red of the throat and other parts becoming bright again
in the beginning of May, or sometimes in April. The scapulars of the
young are conspicuously shorter than the longest primaries, but after the
first moult are equal in length. The upper wing-coverts are then also
short.
</p>

<p>
I have never met with this species in any part of the interior, although
I have procured the Red Phalarope and Wilson’s Phalarope in many
parts to the west of the Alleghany Mountains, at a distance of more than
a thousand miles from the sea coast.

<h2>
FISHING IN THE OHIO.
</h2>

<p>
It is with mingled feelings of pleasure and regret that I recall to my
mind the many pleasant days I have spent on the shores of the Ohio.
The visions of former years crowd on my view, as I picture to myself
the fertile soil and genial atmosphere of our great western garden, Kentucky,
and view the placid waters of the fair stream that flows along its
western boundary. Methinks I am now on the banks of the noble river.
Twenty years of my life have returned to me; my sinews are strong, and
the “bowstring of my spirit is not slack;” bright visions of the future
float before me, as I sit on a grassy bank, gazing on the glittering waters.
Around me are dense forests of lofty trees and thickly tangled undergrowth,
amid which are heard the songs of feathered choristers, and
from whose boughs hang clusters of glowing fruits and beautiful flowers.
Reader, I am very happy. But now the dream has vanished, and here I
am in the British Athens, penning an episode for my Ornithological Biography,
and having before me sundry well-thumbed and weather-beaten
folios, from which I expect to be able to extract some interesting particulars
respecting the methods employed in those days in catching Cat-fish.
</p>

<p>
But, before entering on my subject, I will present you with a brief
description of the place of my residence on the banks of the Ohio. When
I first landed at Henderson in Kentucky, my family, like the village, was
quite small. The latter consisted of six or eight houses; the former of my
wife, myself, and a young child. Few as the houses were, we fortunately
found one empty. It was a log-<i>cabin</i>, not a log-<i>house</i>; but as better
could not be had, we were pleased. Well, then, we were located. The
country around was thinly peopled, and all purchasable provisions rather
scarce; but our neighbours were friendly, and we had brought with us
flour and bacon-hams. Our pleasures were those of young people not
long married, and full of life and merriment; a single smile from our infant
was, I assure you, more valued by us than all the treasures of a
modern Crœsus would have been. The woods were amply stocked with
game, the river with fish; and now and then the hoarded sweets of the
industrious bees were brought from some hollow tree to our little table.
Our child’s cradle was our richest piece of furniture, our guns and fishing-lines
our most serviceable implements, for although we began to cultivate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
a garden, the rankness of the soil kept the seeds we planted far
beneath the tall weeds that sprung up the first year. I had then a partner,
a “man of business,” and there was also with me a Kentucky youth,
who much preferred the sports of the forest and river to either day-book
or ledger. He was naturally, as I may say, a good woodsman, hunter,
and angler, and, like me, thought chiefly of procuring supplies of fish
and fowl. To the task accordingly we directed all our energies.
</p>

<p>
Quantity as well as quality was an object with us, and although we
well knew that three species of Cat-fish existed in the Ohio, and that all
were sufficiently good, we were not sure as to the best method of securing
them. We determined, however, to work on a large scale, and immediately
commenced making a famous “trot-line.” Now, reader, as you may
probably know nothing about this engine, I shall describe it to you.
</p>

<p>
A trot-line is one of considerable length and thickness, both qualities,
however, varying according to the extent of water, and the size of the
fish you expect to catch. As the Ohio, at Henderson, is rather more
than half a mile in breadth, and as Cat-fishes weigh from one to an hundred
pounds, we manufactured a line which measured about two hundred
yards in length, as thick as the little finger of some fair one yet in her
teens, and as white as the damsel’s finger well could be, for it was wholly
of Kentucky cotton, just, let me tell you, because that substance stands
the water better than either hemp or flax. The main line finished, we
made a hundred smaller ones, about five feet in length, to each of which
we fastened a capital hook of <span class="smcap">Kirby</span> and Co.’s manufacture. Now for
the bait!
</p>

<p>
It was the month of May. Nature had brought abroad myriads of
living beings: they covered the earth, glided through the water, and
swarmed in the air. The Cat-fish is a voracious creature, not at all nice
in feeding, but one who, like the vulture, contents himself with carrion
when nothing better can be had. A few experiments proved to us that,
of the dainties with which we tried to allure them to our hooks, they gave
a decided preference, at that season, to <i>live toads</i>. These animals were
very abundant about Henderson. They ramble or feed, whether by instinct
or reason, during early or late twilight more than at any other time,
especially after a shower, and are unable to bear the heat of the sun’s rays
for several hours before and after noon. We have a good number of
these crawling things in America, particularly in the western and southern
parts of the Union, and are very well supplied with frogs, snakes, lizards,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
and even crocodiles, which we call alligators; but there is enough of food
for them all, and we generally suffer them to creep about, to leap or to
flounder as they please, or in accordance with the habits which have been
given them by the great Conductor of all.
</p>

<p>
During the month of May, and indeed until autumn, we found an
abundant supply of toads. Many “fine ladies,” no doubt, would have
swooned, or at least screamed and gone into hysterics, had they seen one
of our baskets filled with these animals, all alive and plump. Fortunately
we had no tragedy queen or sentimental spinster at Henderson. Our
Kentucky ladies mind their own affairs, and seldom meddle with those of
others farther than to do all they can for their comfort. The toads, collected
one by one, and brought home in baskets, were deposited in a
barrel for use. And now that night is over, and as it is the first trial we
are going to give our trot-line, just watch our movements from that high
bank beside the stream. There sit down under the large cotton-wood
tree. You are in no danger of catching cold at this season.
</p>

<p>
My assistant follows me with a gaff hook, while I carry the paddle of
our canoe; a boy bears on his back a hundred toads as good as ever
hopped. Our line—oh, I forgot to inform you that we had set it last
night, but without the small ones you now see on my arm. Fastening
one end to yon sycamore, we paddled our canoe, with the rest nicely
coiled in the stern, and soon reached its extremity, when I threw over the
side the heavy stone fastened to it as a sinker. All this was done that it
might be thoroughly soaked, and without kinks or snarls in the morning.
Now, you observe, we launch our light bark, the toads in the basket are
placed next to my feet in the bow; I have the small lines across my knees
all ready looped at the end. <span class="smcap">Nat</span>, with the paddle, and assisted by
the current, keeps the stern of our boat directly down stream; and <span class="smcap">David</span>
fixes, by the skin of the back and hind parts, the living bait to the hook.
I hold the main line all the while, and now, having fixed one linelet to it,
over goes the latter. Can you see the poor toad kicking and flouncing
in the water? “No”—well, I do. You observe at length that all the
lines, one after another, have been fixed, baited, and dropped. We now
return swiftly to the shore.
</p>

<p>
“What a delightful thing is fishing!” have I more than once heard
some knowing angler exclaim, who, with “the patience of Job,” stands
or slowly moves along some rivulet twenty feet wide, and three or
four feet deep, with a sham fly to allure a trout, which, when at length
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
caught, weighs half a pound. Reader, I never had such patience. Although
I have waited ten years, and yet see only three-fourths of the
Birds of America engraved, although some of the drawings of that work
were patiently made so long ago as 1805, and although I have to wait
with patience two years more before I see the end of it, I never could hold
a line or a rod for many minutes, unless I had—not a “nibble,” but a
hearty bite, and could throw the fish at once over my head on the
ground. No, no—If I fish for trout, I must soon give up, or catch, as
I have done in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh, or the streams of Maine, fifty or
more in a couple of hours. But the trot-line is in the river, and there
it may patiently wait, until I visit it toward night. Now I take up my
gun and note-book, and, accompanied by my dog, intend to ramble
through the woods until breakfast. Who knows but I may shoot a turkey
or a deer? It is barely four o’clock; and see what delightful mornings
we have at this season in Kentucky!
</p>

<p>
Evening has returned. The heavens have already opened their
twinkling eyes, although the orb of day has yet scarcely withdrawn itself
from our view. How calm is the air! The nocturnal insects and
quadrupeds are abroad; the bear is moving through the dark canebrake,
the land crows are flying towards their roosts, their aquatic
brethren towards the interior of the forests, the squirrel is barking his
adieu, and the Barred Owl glides silently and swiftly from his retreat, to
seize upon the gay and noisy animal. The boat is pushed off from the
shore; the main-line is in my hands; now it shakes; surely some fish
have been hooked. Hand over hand I proceed to the first hook. Nothing
there! But now I feel several jerks stronger and more frequent
than before. Several hooks I pass; but see, what a fine Cat-fish is
twisting round and round the little line to which he is fast! <span class="smcap">Nat</span>,
look to your gaff—hook him close to the tail. Keep it up, my dear fellow!—there
now, we have him. More are on, and we proceed. When
we have reached the end many goodly fishes are lying in the bottom of
our skiff. New bait has been put on, and, as we return, I congratulate myself
and my companions on the success of our efforts; for there lies fish
enough for ourselves and our neighbours.
</p>

<p>
A trot-line at this period was perfectly safe at Henderson, should I
have allowed it to remain for weeks at a time. The navigation was
mostly performed by flat-bottomed boats, which during calm nights floated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
in the middle current of the river, so that the people on board could not
observe the fish that had been hooked. Not a single steamer had as yet
ever gone down the Ohio; now and then, it is true, a barge or a keel-boat
was propelled by poles and oars; but the nature of the river is such
at that place, that these boats when ascending were obliged to keep near
the Indiana shore, until above the landing of the village, (below which
I always fixed my lines), when they pulled across the stream.
</p>

<p>
Several species or varieties of Cat-fish are found in the Ohio, namely
the Blue, the White, and the Mud Cats, which differ considerably in
their form and colour, as well as in their habits. The Mud Cat is the
best, although it seldom attains so great a size as the rest. The Blue
Cat is the coarsest, but when not exceeding from four to six pounds, it
affords tolerable eating. The White Cat is preferable to the last, but
not so common; and the Yellow Mud Cat is the best and rarest. Of the
blue kind some have been caught that weighed a hundred pounds. Such
fishes, however, are looked upon as monsters.
</p>

<p>
The form in all the varieties inclines to the conical, the head being
disproportionately large, while the body tapers away to the root of the
tail. The eyes, which are small, are placed far apart, and situated as it
were on the top of the forehead, but laterally. Their mouth is wide, and
armed with numerous small and very sharp teeth, while it is defended by
single-sided spines, which, when the fish is in the agonies of death, stand
out at right angles, and are so firmly fixed as sometimes to break before
you can loosen them. The Cat-fish has also feelers of proportionate
length, apparently intended to guide its motions over the bottom, whilst
its eyes are watching the objects passing above.
</p>

<p>
Trot-lines cannot be used with much success unless during the middle
stages of the water. When very low, it is too clear, and the fish, although
extremely voracious, will rarely risk its life for a toad. When
the waters are rising rapidly, your trot-lines are likely to be carried away
by one of the numerous trees that float in the stream. A “happy medium”
is therefore best.
</p>

<p>
When the waters are rising fast and have become muddy, a single
line is used for catching Cat-fish. It is fastened to the elastic branch of
some willow several feet above the water, and must be twenty or thirty
feet in length. The entrails of a Wild Turkey, or a piece of fresh venison,
furnish good bait; and if, when you visit your line the next morning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
after you have set it, the water has not risen too much, the swinging of
the willow indicates that a fish has been hooked, and you have only to
haul the prize ashore.
</p>

<p>
One evening I saw that the river was rising at a great rate, although
it was still within its banks. I knew that the White Perch were running,
that is, ascending the river from the sea, and, anxious to have a tasting of
that fine fish, I baited a line with a cray-fish, and fastened it to the bough
of a tree. Next morning as I pulled in the line, it felt as if fast at the
bottom, yet on drawing it slowly I found that it came. Presently I felt
a strong pull, the line slipped through my fingers, and next instant a
large Cat-fish leaped out of the water. I played it for a while, until
it became exhausted, when I drew it ashore. It had swallowed the
hook, and I cut off the line close to its head. Then passing a stick
through one of the gills, I and a servant tugged the fish home. On
cutting it open, we, to our surprise, found in its stomach a fine White
Perch, dead, but not in the least injured. The Perch had been lightly
hooked, and the Cat-fish, after swallowing it, had been hooked in the stomach,
so that, although the instrument was small, the torture caused by it
no doubt tended to disable the Cat-fish. The Perch we ate, and the Cat,
which was fine, we divided into four parts, and distributed among our
neighbours. My most worthy friend and relative, <span class="smcap">Nicholas Berthoud</span>,
Esq., who formerly resided at Shippingport in Kentucky, but now in
New York, a better fisher than whom I never knew, once placed a trot-line
in “the basin” below “Tarascon’s Mills,” at the foot of the Rapids
of the Ohio. I cannot recollect the bait which was used; but on taking
up the line we obtained a remarkably fine Cat-fish, in which was found
the greater part of a sucking pig!
</p>

<p>
I may here add, that I have introduced a figure of the Cat-fish in
Plate XXXI. of my first volume of my Illustrations, in which I have
represented the White-headed Eagle.

THE WOOD IBIS.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tantalus loculator</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXVI. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
This very remarkable bird, and all others of the same genus that are
known to occur in the United States, are constant residents in some part
of our Southern Districts, although they perform short migrations. A
few of them now and then stray as far as the Middle States, but instances
of this are rare; and I am not aware that any have been seen farther to
the eastward than the southern portions of Maryland, excepting a few
individuals of the Glossy and the White Ibises, which have been procured
in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. The Carolinas, Georgia,
the Floridas, Alabama, Lower Louisiana, including Opellousas, and Mississippi,
are the districts to which they resort by preference, and in
which they spend the whole year. With the exception of the Glossy
Ibis, which may be looked upon as a bird of the Mexican territories, and
which usually appears in the Union singly or in pairs, they all live socially
in immense flocks, especially during the breeding season. The country
which they inhabit is doubtless the best suited to their habits; the
vast and numerous swamps, lagoons, bayous, and submersed savannahs
that occur in the lower parts of our Southern States, all abounding with
fishes and reptiles; and the temperature of these countries being congenial
to their constitutions.
</p>

<p>
In treating of the bird now under your notice, Mr <span class="smcap">William Bartram</span>
says, “This solitary bird does not associate in flocks, but is generally seen
alone.” This was published by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, and every individual who has
since written on the subject, has copied the assertion without probably
having any other reason than that he believed the authors of it to state a
fact. But the habits of this species are entirely at variance with the above
quotation, to which I direct your attention not without a feeling of pain,
being assured that Mr <span class="smcap">Bartram</span> could have made such a statement only
because he had few opportunities of studying the bird in question in its
proper haunts.
</p>

<p>
The Wood Ibis is rarely met with single, even after the breeding season,
and it is more easy for a person to see an hundred together at any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
period of the year, than to meet with one by itself. Nay, I have seen
flocks composed of several thousands, and that there is a natural necessity
for their flocking together I shall explain to you. This species feeds entirely
on fish and aquatic reptiles, of which it destroys an enormous quantity,
in fact more than it eats; for if they have been killing fish for half
an hour and have gorged themselves, they suffer the rest to lie on the
water untouched, when it becomes food for alligators, crows, and vultures,
whenever these animals can lay hold of it. To procure its food, the
Wood Ibis walks through shallow muddy lakes or bayous in numbers.
As soon as they have discovered a place abounding in fish, they dance as
it were all through it, until the water becomes thick with the mud stirred
from the bottom by their feet. The fishes, on rising to the surface, are
instantly struck by the beaks of the Ibises, which, on being deprived of
life, they turn over and so remain. In the course of ten or fifteen minutes,
hundreds of fishes, frogs, young alligators, and water-snakes cover the
surface, and the birds greedily swallow them until they are completely
gorged, after which they walk to the nearest margins, place themselves in
long rows, with their breasts all turned towards the sun, in the manner of
Pelicans and Vultures, and thus remain for an hour or so. When digestion
is partially accomplished, they all take to wing, rise in spiral circlings
to an immense height, and sail about for an hour or more, performing
the most beautiful evolutions that can well be conceived. Their long
necks and legs are stretched out to their full extent, the pure white of
their plumage contrasts beautifully with the jetty black of the tips of their
wings. Now in large circles they seem to ascend toward the upper regions
of the atmosphere; now, they pitch towards the earth; and again, gently
rising, they renew their gyrations. Hunger once more induces them to
go in search of food, and, with extended front, the band sails rapidly towards
another lake or bayou.
</p>

<p>
Mark the place, reader, and follow their course through cane-brake,
cypress-swamp, and tangled wood. Seldom do they return to the same
feeding place on the same day. You have reached the spot, and are
standing on the margin of a dark-watered bayou, the sinuosities of which
lead your eye into a labyrinth ending in complete darkness. The tall
canes bow to each other from the shores; the majestic trees above them,
all hung with funereal lichen, gently wave in the suffocating atmosphere;
the bullfrog, alarmed, shrinks back into the water; the alligator raises
his head above its surface, probably to see if the birds have arrived, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
the wily cougar is stealthily advancing toward one of the Ibises, which he
expects to carry off into the thicket. Through the dim light your eye
catches a glimpse of the white-plumaged birds, moving rapidly like spectres
to and fro. The loud clacking of their mandibles apprises you of the
havock they commit among the terrified inhabitants of the waters, while
the knell-like sounds of their feet come with a feeling of dread. Move,
gently or not, move at all, and you infallibly lose your opportunity of
observing the actions of the birds. Some old male has long marked you;
whether it has been with eye or with ear, no matter. The first stick
your foot cracks, his hoarse voice sounds the alarm. Off they all go,
battering down the bending canes with their powerful pinions, and breaking
the smaller twigs of the trees, as they force a passage for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Talk to me of the stupidity of birds, of the dulness of the Wood Ibis!
say it is fearless, easily approached, and easily shot. I listen, but it is
merely through courtesy; for I have so repeatedly watched its movements,
in all kinds of circumstances, that I am quite convinced we have not in
the United States a more shy, wary, and vigilant bird than the Wood
Ibis. In the course of two years spent, I may say, among them, for I
saw some whenever I pleased during that period, I never succeeded in
surprising one, not even under night, when they were roosting on trees at
a height of nearly a hundred feet, and sometimes rendered farther secure
by being over extensive swamps.
</p>

<p>
My Journal informs me, that, one autumn while residing near Bayou
Sara, being intent on procuring eight or ten of these birds, to skin
for my learned and kind friend the Prince of Musignano, I took with me
two servants, who were first-rate woodsmen, and capital hands at the rifle,
and that notwithstanding our meeting with many hundreds of Wood Ibises,
it took us three days to shoot fifteen, which were for the most part
killed on wing with rifle-balls, at a distance of about a hundred yards.
On that occasion we discovered that a flock roosted regularly over a large
corn field covered with huge girted trees, the tops of which were almost
all decayed. We stationed ourselves apart in the field, concealed among
the tall ripened corn, and in silence awaited the arrival of the birds.
After the sun had disappeared, the broad front of a great flock of Ibises
was observed advancing towards us. They soon alighted in great numbers
on the large branches of the dead trees; but whenever one of the
branches gave way under their weight, all at once rose in the air, flew
about several times, and alighted again. One of my companions, having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
a good opportunity, fired, and brought two down with a single bullet;
but here the sport was ended. In five minutes after, not an Ibis was
within a mile of the place, nor did any return to roost there for more
than a month. When on the margin of a lake, or even in the centre of
it—for all the lakes they frequent are exceedingly shallow—the first
glimpse they have of a man induces them to exert all their vigilance;
and should he after this advance a few steps, the birds fly off.
</p>

<p>
The name of “Wood Ibis” given to this bird, is not more applicable
to it than to any other species; for every one with which I am acquainted
resorts quite as much to the woods at particular periods. All our species
may be found on wet savannahs, on islands surrounded even by the waters
of the sea, the Florida Keys for example, or in the most secluded parts
of the darkest woods, provided they are swampy, or are furnished with
ponds. I have found the Wood, the Red, the White, the Brown, and
the Glossy Ibises, around ponds in the centre of immense forests; and
in such places, even in the desolate pine-barrens of the Floridas; sometimes
several hundred miles from the sea coast, on the Red River, in the
State of Louisiana, and above Natchez, in that of Mississippi, as well as
within a few miles of the ocean. Yet, beyond certain limits, I never saw
one of these birds.
</p>

<p>
One of the most curious circumstances connected with this species is,
that although the birds are, when feeding, almost constantly within the
reach of large alligators, of which they devour the young, these reptiles
never attack them; whereas if a Duck or a Heron comes within the reach
of their tails, it is immediately killed and swallowed. The Wood Ibis
will wade up to its belly in the water, round the edges of “alligators’
holes,” without ever being injured; but should one of these birds be shot,
an alligator immediately makes towards it and pulls it under water. The
gar-fish is not so courteous, but gives chase to the Ibises whenever an opportunity
occurs. The Snapping Turtle is also a great enemy to the
young birds of this species.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Wood Ibis is heavy at its rising from the ground.
Its neck at that moment is deeply curved downward, its wings flap heavily
but with great power, and its long legs are not stretched out behind
until it has proceeded many yards. But as soon as it has attained a
height of eight or ten feet, it ascends with great celerity, generally in a
spiral direction, in silence if not alarmed, or, if frightened, with a rough
croaking guttural note. When fairly on wing, they proceed in a direct
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
flight, with alternate flappings and sailings of thirty or forty yards, the
sailings more prolonged than the flappings. They alight on trees with
more ease than Herons generally do, and either stand erect or crouch on
the branches, in the manner of the Wild Turkey, the Herons seldom
using the latter attitude. When they are at rest, they place their bill
against the breast, while the neck shrinks as it were between the shoulders.
In this position you may see fifty on the same tree, or on the
ground, reposing in perfect quiet for hours at a time, although some individual
of the party will be constantly on the look-out, and ready to
sound the alarm.
</p>

<p>
In the spring months, when these birds collect in large flocks, before
they return to their breeding places, I have seen thousands together, passing
over the woods in a line more than a mile in extent, and moving with
surprising speed at the height of only a few yards above the trees. When
a breeding place has once been chosen, it is resorted to for years in succession;
nor is it easy to make them abandon it after they have deposited
their eggs, although, if much annoyed, they never return to it after that
season.
</p>

<p>
Besides the great quantity of fishes that these Ibises destroy, they also
devour frogs, young alligators, wood-rats, young rails and grakles, fiddlers
and other crabs, as well as snakes and small turtles. They never eat the
eggs of the alligator, as has been alleged, although they probably would
do so, could they demolish the matted nests of that animal, a task beyond
the power of <i>any</i> bird known to me. I never saw one eat any thing which
either it or some of its fellows had not killed. Nor will it eat an animal
that has been dead for some time, even although it may have been killed
by itself. When eating, the clacking of their mandibles may be heard at
the distance of several hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
When wounded, it is dangerous to approach them, for they bite severely.
They may be said to be very tenacious of life. Although
usually fat, they are very tough and oily, and therefore are not fit for
food. The Negroes, however, eat them, having, previous to cooking them,
torn off the skin, as they do with Pelicans and Cormorants. My own
attempts, I may add, were not crowned with success. Many of the Negroes
of Louisiana destroy these birds when young, for the sake of the
oil which their flesh contains, and which they use in greasing machines.
</p>

<p>
The French Creoles of that State name them “Grands Flamans,”
while the Spaniards of East Florida know them by the name of “Gannets.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
When in the latter country, at St Augustine, I was induced to
make an excursion, to visit a large pond or lake, where I was assured
there were Gannets in abundance, which I might shoot off the trees,
provided I was careful enough. On asking the appearance of the Gannets,
I was told that they were large white birds, with wings black at the end,
a long neck, and a large sharp bill. The description so far agreeing with
that of the Common Gannet or Solan Goose, I proposed no questions respecting
the legs or tail, but went off. Twenty-three miles, Reader, I
trudged through the woods, and at last came in view of the pond; when,
lo! its borders and the trees around it were covered with Wood Ibises.
Now, as the good people who gave the information spoke according to their
knowledge, and agreeably to their custom of calling the Ibises Gannets,
had I not gone to the pond, I might have written this day that Gannets
are found in the interior of the woods in the Floridas, that they alight on
trees, &amp;c. which, if <i>once</i> published, would in all probability have gone
down to future times through the medium of compilers, and all perhaps
without acknowledgment.
</p>

<p>
The Wood Ibis takes four years in attaining full maturity, although
birds of the second year are now and then found breeding. This is rare,
however, for the young birds live in flocks by themselves, until they have
attained the age of about three years. They are at first of a dingy brown,
each feather edged with paler; the head is covered to the mandibles with
short downy feathers, which gradually fall off as the bird advances in age.
In the third year, the head is quite bare, as well as a portion of the upper
part of the neck. In the fourth year, the bird is as you see it in the plate.
The male is much larger and heavier than the female, but there is no
difference in colour between the sexes.

When the Wood Ibis has caught a fish too large to be easily swallowed,
it shakes its head in a violent manner, as if to force its prey down or
drive it up again. In the latter case, it carries the fish to the shore, and
breaks it into pieces, which it then swallows.
</p>

<p>
This species has the subcutaneous cellular tissue highly developed,
especially along the breast, and the lower parts of the body, although not
by any means so much so as in the Brown Pelican. I have represented
a flock of these birds in the back ground, with the view of giving you an
idea of the swamps to which they usually resort. They are on the edge
of an alligator’s hole, at their avocations. The trees, clad with dangling
mosses, afford evidence of the insalubrity of the atmosphere. You see
the alligators with their heads and backs above water, watching the motions
of the birds.

<h2>
LOUISIANA HERON.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea Ludoviciana</i>, Wils.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXVII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Delicate in form, beautiful in plumage, and graceful in its movements,
I never see this interesting Heron, without calling it the Lady of
the Waters. Watch its motions, as it leisurely walks over the pure sand
beaches of the coast of Florida, arrayed in the full beauty of its spring
plumage. Its pendent crest exhibits its glossy tints, its train falls gracefully
over a well defined tail, and the tempered hues of its back and
wings contrast with those of its lower parts. Its measured steps are so
light that they leave no impression on the sand, and with its keen eye
it views every object around with the most perfect accuracy. See, it has
spied a small fly lurking on a blade of grass, it silently runs a few steps,
and with the sharp point of its bill it has already secured the prey. The
minnow just escaped from the pursuit of some larger fish has almost rushed
upon the beach for safety; but the quick eye of the Heron has observed
its motions, and in an instant it is swallowed alive. Among the herbage
yet dripping with dew the beautiful bird picks its steps. Not a snail can
escape its keen search, and as it moves around the muddy pool, it secures
each water lizard that occurs. Now the sun’s rays have dried up the
dews, the flowers begin to droop, the woodland choristers have ended their
morning concert, and like them, the Heron, fatigued with its exertions,
seeks a place of repose under the boughs of the nearest bush, where it
may in safety await the coolness of the evening. Then for a short while
it again searches for food. Little difficulty does it experience in this;
and at length, with the last glimpse of day, it opens its wings, and flies
off towards its well-known roosting-place, where it spends the night contented
and happy.
</p>

<p>
This species, which is a constant resident in the southern parts of the
peninsula of the Floridas, seldom rambles far from its haunts during the
winter season, being rarely seen at that period beyond Savannah in Georgia
to the eastward. To the west it extends to the broad sedgy flats
bordering the mouths of the Mississippi, along the whole Gulf of Mexico,
and perhaps much farther south. In the beginning of spring, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
found abundantly in the Carolinas, and sometimes as far east as Maryland,
or up the Mississippi as high as Natchez. You never find it far
inland: perhaps forty miles would be a considerable distance at any time
of the year. It is at all seasons a social bird, moving about in company
with the Blue Heron or the White Egret. It also frequently associates
with the larger species, and breeds in the same places, along with the
White Heron, the Yellow-crowned Heron, and the Night Heron; but
more generally it resorts to particular spots for this purpose, keeping by
itself, and assembling in great numbers. Those which visit the Carolinas,
or the country of the Mississippi, make their appearance there about the
first of April, or when the Egrets and other species of Heron seek the
same parts, returning to the Floridas or farther south about the middle
of September, although I have known some to remain there during mild
winters. When this is the case, all the other species may be met with in
the same places, as the Louisiana Heron is the most delicate in constitution
of all. Whilst at St Augustine in Florida, in the month of January,
I found this species extremely abundant there; but after a hard frost of
a few days, they all disappeared, leaving the other Herons, none of which
seemed to be affected by the cold, and returned again as soon as the Fahrenheit
thermometer rose to 80°. There they were in full livery by the
end of February, and near Charleston by the 5th of April.
</p>

<p>
Although timid, they are less shy than most other species, and more
easily procured. I have frequently seen one alight at the distance of a
few yards, and gaze on me as if endeavouring to discover my intentions.
This apparent insensibility to danger has given rise to the appellation of
<i>Egrette folle</i>, which is given to them in Lower Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this beautiful Heron is light, rather irregular, swifter than
that of any other species, and capable of being considerably protracted.
They usually move in long files, rather widely separated, and in an undulating
manner, with constant flappings. When proceeding towards their
roosts, or when on their migrations, they pass as high over the country as
other species; on the former occasion, they pass and repass over the same
tract, thus enabling the gunner easily to shoot them, which he may especially
calculate on doing at the approach of night, when they are gorged with
food, and fly lower than in the morning. They may, however, be still
more surely obtained on their arriving at their roosting place, where they
alight at once among the lowest branches. On being shot at, they seldom
fly to a great distance, and their attachment to a particular place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
is such that you are sure to find them there during the whole period of
their stay in the country, excepting the breeding time. At the cry of a
wounded one, they assail you in the manner of some Gulls and Terns,
and may be shot in great numbers by any person fond of such sport.
</p>

<p>
On the 29th of April, while wading around a beautiful key of the
Floridas, in search of certain crustaceous animals called the sea Cray-fish,
my party and I suddenly came upon one of the breeding places of the
Louisiana Heron. The southern exposures of this lovely island were
overgrown with low trees and bushes matted together by thousands of
smilaxes and other creeping plants, supported by various species of cactus.
Among the branches some hundred pairs of these lovely birds had
placed their nests, which were so low and so close to each other, that
without moving a step one could put his hand into several. The birds
thus taken by surprise rose affrighted into the air, bitterly complaining
of being disturbed in their secluded retreat. The nests were formed of
small dried sticks crossing each other in various ways. They were flat,
had little lining, and each contained three eggs, all the birds being then
incubating. Observing that many eggs had been destroyed by the Crows
and Buzzards, as the shells were scattered on the ground, I concluded
that many of the Herons had laid more than once, to make up their full
complement of eggs; for my opinion is, that all our species, excepting
the Green Heron, never lay more nor less than three, unless an accident
should happen. The eggs of the Louisiana Heron measure one inch
and six and a half twelfths in length, an inch and a quarter in breadth;
they are nearly elliptical, of a beautiful pale blue colour inclining to green,
smooth, and with a very thin shell. The period of incubation is twenty-one
days. Like all other species of the genus, this raises only one brood
in the season. The little island of which I have spoken lies exposed to
the sea, and has an extent of only a few acres. The trees or bushes with
which it was covered seemed to have been stunted by the effect produced
by their having been for years the receptacles of the Herons’ nests.
</p>

<p>
On the 19th May, in the same year, I found another breeding place
of this species not far from Key West. The young birds, which stood
on all the branches of the trees and bushes on the southern side of the
place, were about the size of our Little Partridge. Their notes, by which
we had been attracted to the spot, were extremely plaintive, and resembled
the syllables <i>wiee, wiee, wiee</i>. When we went up to them, the old birds
all flew to another key, as if intent on drawing us there; but in vain, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
we took with us a good number of their young. It was surprising to see
the little fellows moving about among the branches, clinging to them in
all sorts of curious positions, and persevering in forcing their way toward
the water, when over which they at once dropped, and swam off from us
with great vigour and speed. When seized with the hand, they defended
themselves to the utmost. At this early period, they plainly shewed the
sprouting feathers of the crest. Many Crow Blackbirds had nests on the
same mangroves, and a Fish-Hawk also had formed its nest there at a
height of not more than five feet from the water. On the 24th of May,
these Herons were fully fledged, and able to fly to a short distance. In
this state we, with some difficulty, procured one alive. Its legs and feet
were green, the bill black, but its eyes, like those of an adult bird, were
of a beautiful red hue. Many were caught afterwards and taken as passengers
on board the Marion. They fed on any garbage thrown to them
by the sailors; but whenever another species came near them, they leaped
towards its bill, caught hold of it as if it had been a fish, and hung to it
until shaken off by their stronger associates. On several occasions, however,
the <i>Ardea occidentalis</i> shook them off violently, and after beating
them on the deck, swallowed them before they could be rescued!
</p>

<p>
The place farthest up on the Mississippi where I have found this species
breeding was on Buffalo Creek, about forty miles below Natchez,
and ten miles in a direct line from the great river. To the eastward I
have found them, breeding in company with the Green Heron and the
Night Heron, within a few miles of Charleston.
</p>

<p>
During summer and autumn, after the old birds have left their young,
both are frequently seen in the rice-fields, feeding along the ditches by
which the water is led to those places. At this season they are uncommonly
gentle and easily approached.
</p>

<p>
The Louisiana Heron acquires the full beauty of its plumage the
second year after its birth, although it continues for some time to increase
in size. The train and crest lengthen for several years until they become
as represented in the plate. To procure specimens in such complete
plumage, however, requires some care, for this state does not last many
days after pairing has taken place, and by the time the young are hatched
much of this fine plumage has dropped. When autumn has come,
only a few of the long barbs remain, and in winter no appearance of them
can be seen.
</p>

<p>
The flesh of the young birds affords tolerable eating. The food of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
this species consists of small fry, water insects, worms, slugs, and snails,
as well as leeches, tadpoles, and aquatic lizards.

<p>
This bird is seldom found farther south than the entrance of the Bay
of New York, where, however, it appears only during severe winters,
for being one of the most hardy inhabitants of the northern regions,
its constitution is such as to enable it to bear without injury the rigours
of their wintry climates. About the bays near Boston the Guillemots
are seen every year in greater or less numbers, and from thence to the
eastward they become gradually more abundant. A very old gunner whom
I employed while at Boston, during the winter of 1832-3, assured me,
that when he was a young man, this species bred on many of the rocky
islands about the mouth of the bay there; but that for about twenty
years back none remained after the first days of April, when they departed
for the north in company with the Thick-billed Guillemot, the Common
Auk, the Puffin, and the Eider and King Ducks, all of which visit
these bays in hard weather. In the Bay of Fundy, the Foolish Guillemot
is very numerous, and is known by the name of <i>Murre</i>, which it retains
among all the eggers and fishermen of Newfoundland and Labrador,
where it breeds in myriads. To those countries, then, I must lead you,
good Reader, as there we can with ease study the habits of these birds.
</p>

<p>
Stay on the deck of the Ripley by my side this clear and cold morning.
See how swiftly scuds our gallant bark, as she cuts her way through
the foaming billows, now inclining to the right and again to the left. Far
in the east, dark banks of low clouds indicate foul weather to the wary
mariner, who watches the approach of a northern storm with anxiety.
Suddenly the wind changes; but for this he has prepared; the topsails
are snugged to their yards, and the rest are securely reefed. A thick fog
obscures all around us. The waters suddenly checked in their former
course, furiously war against those which now strike them in front. The
uproar increases, the bark is tossed on every side; now a sweeping wave
rushes against the bows, the vessel quivers, while down along her deck
violently pour the waters, rolling from side to side, seeking for a place
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
by which they may escape. At this moment all about you are in dismay
save the Guillemots. The sea is covered with these intrepid navigators
of the deep. Over each tumultuous billow they swim unconcerned on
the very spray at the bow of the vessel, and plunging as if with pleasure,
up they come next moment at the rudder. Others fly around in large
circles, while thousands contend with the breeze, moving directly against
it in long lines, towards regions unknown to all, save themselves and some
other species of sea birds.
</p>

<p>
The Guillemots pair during their migrations;—many of them at least
do so. While on my way toward Labrador, they were constantly within
sight, gambolling over the surface of the water, the males courting the
females, and the latter receiving the caresses of their mates. These would
at times rise erect in the sea, swell their throats, and emit a hoarse puffing
guttural note, to which the females at once responded, with numerous
noddings to their beaux. Then the pair would rise, take a round in the
air, re-alight, and seal the conjugal compact; after which they flew or
swam together for the season, and so closely, that among multitudes on
the wing or on the waves, one might easily distinguish a mated pair.
</p>

<p>
Not far from Great Macatina Harbour lie the Murre Rocks, consisting
of several low islands, destitute of vegetation, and not rising high
from the waters. There thousands of Guillemots annually assemble in
the beginning of May, to deposit each its single egg, and raise its young.
As you approach these islands, the air becomes darkened with the multitudes
of birds that fly about; every square foot of the ground seems to
be occupied by a Guillemot planted erect as it were on the granite rock,
but carefully warming its cherished egg. All look toward the south, and
if you are fronting them, the snowy white of their bodies produces a very
remarkable effect, for the birds at some distance look as if they were
destitute of head, so much does that part assimilate with the dark hue
of the rocks on which they stand. On the other hand, if you approach
them in the rear, the isle appears as if covered with a black pall.
</p>

<p>
Now land, and witness the consternation of the settlers! Each affrighted
leaves its egg, hastily runs a few steps, and launches into the
air in silence. Thrice around you they rapidly pass, to discover the object
of your unwelcome visit. If you begin to gather their eggs, or,
still worse, to break them, in order that they may lay others which you
can pick up fresh, the Guillemots all alight at some distance, on the bosom
of the deep, and anxiously await your departure. Eggs, green and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
white, and almost of every colour, are lying thick over the whole rock;
the ordure of the birds mingled with feathers, with the refuse of half-hatched
eggs partially sucked by rapacious Gulls, and with putrid or
dried carcasses of Guillemots, produces an intolerable stench; and no
sooner are all your baskets filled with eggs, than you are glad to abandon
the isle to its proper owners.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion, whilst at anchor at Great Macatina, one of our boats
was sent for eggs. The sailors had eight miles to pull before reaching
the Murre Islands, and yet ere many hours had elapsed, the boat was
again alongside, loaded to a few inches of the gunwale, with 2500 eggs!
Many of them, however, being addle, were thrown overboard. The order
given to the tars had been to bring only a few dozens; but, as they said,
they had forgotten!
</p>

<p>
The eggs are unaccountably large for the size of the bird, their average
length being three inches and three-eighths, and their greatest
breadth two inches. They are pyriform or elongated, with a slight compression
towards the smaller end, which again rather swells and is rounded
at the extremity. They afford excellent food, being highly nutritive and
palatable, whether boiled, roasted, poached, or in omelets. The shell is
rough to the touch, although not granulated. Some are of a lively verdigris
colour, others of different tints, but all curiously splashed, as it were,
with streaks or blotches of dark umber and brown. My opinion, however,
is, that, when first dropped, they are always pure white, for on opening
a good number of these birds, I found several containing an egg ready
for being laid, and of a pure white colour. The shell is so firm that it
does not easily break, and I have seen a quantity of these eggs very carelessly
removed from a basket into a boat without being damaged. They
are collected in astonishing quantities by “the eggers,” to whom I have
already given a character, and sent to distant markets, where they are
sold at from one to three cents each.
</p>

<p>
Although the Guillemots are continually harassed, their eggs being
carried off as soon as they are deposited, and as long as the birds can
produce them, yet they return to the same islands year after year, and,
notwithstanding all the efforts of their enemies, multiply their numbers.
</p>

<p>
The Foolish Guillemot, as I have said, lays only a single egg, which
is the case with the Thick-billed Guillemot also. The Razor-billed Auk
lays two, and the Black Guillemot usually three. I have assured myself
of these facts, not merely by observing the birds sitting on their eggs,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
but also by noticing the following circumstances. The Foolish Guillemot,
which lays only one, plucks the feathers from its abdomen, which
is thus left quite bare over a roundish space just large enough to cover
its single egg. The Thick-billed Guillemot does the same. The Auk,
on the contrary, forms two bare spots, separated by a ridge of feathers.
The Black Guillemot, to cover her three eggs, and to warm them all at
once, plucks a space bare quite across her belly. These observations
were made on numerous birds of all the species mentioned. In all of
them, the males incubate as well as the females, although the latter are
more assiduous. When the Guillemots are disturbed, they fly off in
silence. The Auks, on the contrary, emit a hoarse croaking note, which
they repeat several times, as they fly away from danger. The Foolish
Guillemot seldom if ever attempts to bite, whereas the Razor-billed Auk
bites most severely, and clings to a person’s hand until choked. The plumage
of all the birds of this family is extremely compact, closely downed
at the root, and difficult to be plucked. The fishermen and eggers often
use their skins with the feathers on as “comforters” round their wrists.
The flesh is dark, tough, and not very palatable; yet many of these birds
are eaten by the fishermen and sailors.
</p>

<p>
The young, which burst the egg about the beginning of July, are
covered with down of a brownish-black colour. When eight or ten days
old they are still downy, but have acquired considerable activity. As
they grow up, they become excessively fat, and seem to be more at ease
on the water than on the land. About the middle of August they follow
their parents to the open sea, the latter being then seldom able to fly,
having dropped their quills; and by the middle of September scarcely
any of these birds are to be found on or near the islands on which they
breed, although great numbers spend the winter in those latitudes.
</p>

<p>
There is no perceptible difference between the sexes as to colour, but
the males are larger than the females. The white line that encircles the
eye and extends toward the hind head is common to both sexes, but occurs
only in old birds. Thousands of these Guillemots however breed,
without having yet acquired it, there merely being indications of it to
be seen on parting the feathers on the place, where there is a natural division.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Foolish Guillemot is rapid and greatly protracted,
being performed by quick and unintermitted beatings. They move
through the air either singly or in bands, in the latter case seldom keeping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
any very regular order. Sometimes they seem to skim along the surface
for miles, while at other times they fly at the height of thirty or forty
yards. They are expert divers, using their wings like fins, and under
water looking like winged fishes. They frequently plunge at the flash of
the gun, and disappear for a considerable time. Before rising, they are
obliged to run as it were on the water, fluttering for many yards before
they get fairly on wing.
</p>

<p>
Those which I kept alive for weeks on board the Ripley, walked
about and ran with ease, with the whole length of their tarsus touching
the deck. They took leaps on chests and other objects to raise themselves,
but could not fly without being elevated two or three feet, although
when they are on the rocks, and can take a run of eight or ten yards,
they easily rise on wing.
</p>

<p>
The islands on which the Guillemots breed on the coast of Labrador,
are flattish at top, and it is there, on the bare rock, that they deposit
their eggs. I saw none standing on the shelvings of high rocks, although
many breed in such places in some parts of Europe. Their food consists
of small fish, shrimps, and other marine animals; and they swallow some
gravel also.

<h2>
THE BLACK GUILLEMOT.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Uria Grylle</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXIX. Adult in Summer, Adult in Winter, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
It was a frightful thing to see my good Captain, <span class="smcap">Henry Emery</span>,
swinging on a long rope upon the face of a rocky and crumbling eminence,
at a height of several hundred feet from the water, in search of
the eggs of the Black Guillemot, with four or five sailors holding the
rope above, and walking along the edge of the precipice. I stood watching
the motions of the adventurous sailor. When the friction of the rope
by which he was suspended loosened a block, which with awful crash came
tumbling down from above him, he, with a promptness and dexterity that
appeared to me quite marvellous, would, by a sudden jerk, throw himself
aside to the right or left, and escape the danger. Now he would run
his arm into a fissure, which, if he found it too deep, he would probe
with a boat-hook. Whenever he chanced to touch a bird, it would come
out whirring like a shot in his face; while others came flying from afar
toward their beloved retreats with so much impetuosity as almost to alarm
the bold rocksman. After much toil and trouble he procured only a few
eggs, it not being then the height of the breeding season. You may imagine,
good Reader, how relieved I felt when I saw Mr <span class="smcap">Emery</span> drawn up,
and once more standing on the bold eminence waving his hat as a signal
of success. This happened in one of the Magdeleine Islands, in the Gulf
of St Lawrence.
</p>

<p>
During severe winters, I have seen the Black Guillemot playing over
the waters as far south as the shores of Maryland. Such excursions,
however, are of rare occurrence, and it is seldom that any of these birds
are to be seen until you reach the Bay of Boston. About the different
entrances of the Bay of Fundy, this species is a constant resident, and
many individuals breed in fissures, at a moderate height above the water,
on the rocky shores of the Island of Grand Manan, and others in the
same latitude. Proceeding farther toward the north-east, we found them
on Jesticoe Island, and wherever else we happened to touch on our way
to Labrador, in which country there is a regular nursery of these birds.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the Foolish and Thick-billed Guillemots, or the Razor-billed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
Auk, they do not confine themselves to any particular spot, but take up
their abode for the season in any place that presents suitable conveniences.
Wherever there are fissures in the rocks, or great piles of blocks
with holes in their interstices, there you may expect to find the Black
Guillemot.
</p>

<p>
Whether European writers have spoken of this species at random, or
after due observation, I cannot say. All I know is, that every one of them
whose writings I have consulted, says that the Black Guillemot lays only
<i>one egg</i>. As I have no reason whatever to doubt their assertion, I
might be tempted to suppose that our species differs from theirs, were I
not perfectly aware that birds in different places will construct different
nests, and lay more or fewer eggs. Our species always deposits three,
unless it may have been disturbed; and this fact I have assured myself
of by having caught the birds in more than twenty instances sitting
on that number. Nay, on several occasions, at Labrador, some of my
party and myself <i>saw</i> several Black Guillemots sitting on eggs in the
same fissure of a rock, where every bird had three eggs under it, a
fact which I communicated to my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span>. What
was most surprising to me was, that even the fishermen there thought
that this bird laid only a single egg; and when I asked them how
they knew, they simply and good-naturedly answered that they had
heard so. Thus, Reader, I might have been satisfied with the sayings
of others, and repeated that the bird in question lays one egg;
but instead of taking this easy way of settling the matter, I found it necessary
to convince myself of the fact by my own observation. I had
therefore to receive many knocks and bruises in scrambling over rugged
crags and desolate headlands; whereas, with less incredulity, I might very
easily have announced to you from my easy chair in Edinburgh, that the
Black Guillemots of America lay only a single egg. No true student of
nature ought ever to be satisfied without personal observation when it
can be obtained. It is the “American Woodsman” that tells you so,
anxious as he is that you should enjoy the pleasure of studying and admiring
the beautiful works of Nature.
</p>

<p>
To satisfy yourself as to the correctness of the statements which he
here lays before you, go to the desolate shores of Labrador. There, in
the vernal month of June, place yourself on some granite rock, against
the base of which the waves dash in impotent rage; and ere long you
will see the gay Guillemot coming from afar by the side of its mate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
They shoot past you on fluttering wings, and suddenly disappear. Go
to the place; lay yourself down on the dripping rock, and you will be
sure to see the birds preparing their stony nest, for each has brought a
smooth pebble in its bill. See how industriously they are engaged in
raising this cold fabric into the form of a true nest, before the female lays
her eggs, so that no wet may reach them, from the constant trickling of
the waters beneath. Up to the height of two or three inches the pebbles
are gradually raised, the male stands by his beloved; and some morning
when you peep into the crevice, you observe that an egg has been deposited.
Two days after you find the number complete.
</p>

<p>
A closet-naturalist was quite surprised, I have been told, when he
read in one of my volumes that Grakles form no nests in one portion
of the United States, being there contented with merely dropping their
eggs in the bottom of a Woodpecker’s hole; while in the Middle States
the same species forms a very snug nest. That <i>his</i> astonishment was
great I do not in the least doubt, especially as I know how surprised
I was to find the <i>Larus argentatus</i> breeding on fir-trees forty feet above
the ground, and to see three eggs, instead of one, placed on a bed of
small pebbles beautifully arranged, and every one belonging to a single
pair of Black Guillemots. Yet, good Reader, as I have also been told,
the same person had no doubt whatever that ermines turn from brown
to white in winter, that snakes and crabs cast off their skins and shells,
and that “fleas are not lobsters;” but then the reason of his belief was
simply that he had read of these things; and his doubts as to the Grakles
arose from the facts having been recently reported by a stranger from the
“far west,” who, it seems, talked of things which he had not read of before.
</p>

<p>
Whilst in Labrador, I was delighted to see with what judgment the
Black Guillemot prepares a place for its eggs. Whenever the spot chosen
happens to be so situated as to preclude damp, not a pebble does the bird
lay there, and its eggs are placed on the bare rock. It is only in what I
call cases of urgency that this trouble is taken. About fifty or sixty
pebbles or bits of stone are then used, and the number is increased or diminished
according to circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The eggs of this species, which appear disproportionately large, measure
two inches and three eighths in length, by an inch and five-eighths
in breadth. Their form is regular; they are rather rough to the touch,
although not granulated; their ground colour an earthy white, thickly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
blotched with very dark purplish-black, the markings larger and closer
towards the great end, which, however, is generally left free of them.
The shell is much thinner than that of the egg of the Foolish Guillemot
or Razor-billed Auk. As an article of food they are excellent, being delicate
and nutritious.
</p>

<p>
The parents pluck the feathers from a space across the lower part of
their belly, as soon as incubation commences; and this bare place, when
the bird is taken alive, it immediately conceals by drawing the feathers of
the upper part of the abdomen over it, as if it were anxious that it should
not be observed. When driven from the nest, the Black Guillemot at
once runs out of its hiding-place and flies to the water, on which it plays,
bathes as it were, dives a few times, and anxiously watches your retreat,
after which it soon returns and resumes the arduous task of incubation.
</p>

<p>
The young, which are at first quite black, are covered with soft down,
and emit, although in an under tone, the same lisping notes as their parents.
Their legs, feet, and bill are black. The red colour of the legs
of the old birds is much brighter during the breeding-season than at any
other time, and the mouth also is bright red. About the first of August
the Guillemots lead their progeny to the water, and although at this time
neither old nor young are able to fly, they dive deeply and with great
ease, which enables them to procure abundance of food, for at this season,
lints, shrimps, and marine insects are plentiful in all the waters.
</p>

<p>
While in Labrador, I made a severe experiment to ascertain how long
the Black Guillemot could live without food,—an experiment on which
I have never since been able to think, without some feeling of remorse.
I confined a pair of them in the fissure of a rock for many days in succession.
After the entrance was securely closed, I left the place, and for
eight days the wind blew so hard that no boat was safe on the waters
without the harbour. Many a time I thought of the poor captives, and
at last went to their retreat one rainy afternoon, over a great swell of the
sea. The entrance of the fissure was opened, and a stick pushed into the
hole, when I had the pleasure of seeing both birds, although apparently
in a state of distress, run out by me, and at once fly to the water.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Black Guillemot is rapid and continued. As they
proceed in their course, they alternately shew the black of their lower
parts and the white of their wings. They walk on the rocks with considerable
ease, using short steps, and whenever they wish to remove from one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
crag or block to another, make use of their wings. When their nests are very
high above the water, they fly directly into them; and from such heights,
if necessity demands it, they at once dive towards the water.
</p>

<p>
I kept many alive on board the Ripley. They ran on the floor in an
erect position for a few yards, fell down on their breasts, rose again, and
continued their exertions to escape, until they got fairly concealed behind
a chest or barrel.
</p>

<p>
The winter plumage of this species differs so greatly from that of summer,
that I have been induced to present you with a figure of the bird in
both states. It is difficult to perceive any external difference between the
sexes, only the males are rather larger than the females. Their flesh, although
black and tough, is not very unpalatable.
</p>

<p>
The trachea is flattened, with numerous close, transparent rings. The
gullet, as in all the other species of this genus, is very dilatable. The
gizzard, which is small, has its inner membrane thin and of a yellow colour.
The intestines are about the thickness of a goose quill, and measure
two feet eight inches in length.

<h2>
THE PIPING PLOVER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">

<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
During the spring and summer months, this pretty little Plover is
found on the sandy beaches of our extensive coasts, from the southern
point of the Floridas to the confines of Maine. As you proceed towards
Labrador, you find it in every suitable place, as far as the Magdeleine
Islands, on the sands of which I saw many that were paired and had eggs
on the 11th of June 1833. It breeds on all parts of the eastern coast of
the United States, wherever the locality is adapted to its habits. On the
3d of May, this bird was found with eggs on the Keys of the Floridas;
about a month later, you may meet with it in the States of Maryland,
New Jersey, and New York. Those which leave the south at the approach
of spring, return to it about October: and during the whole winter
you may find them on the sandy beaches, from South Carolina to the
western coast of the Floridas. The species, therefore, may be considered
as resident with us.
</p>

<p>
While migrating eastward, the Piping Plovers proceed in pairs; and
should one of these on its way find a convenient place for breeding, and
remain there, several others are often induced to take up their abode in
the neighbourhood. In autumn, they go in flocks of twenty or thirty individuals,
and at times associate with other species, particularly the Turnstone,
in whose company I have found them abundantly on the coast of
Florida, in the winter months. They never proceed to any distance inland,
even along the sandy margins of our largest rivers; nor are they seen
along very rocky shores or places covered with deep mud.
</p>

<p>
The favourite breeding stations of this species are low islands, mostly
covered with drifting sand, having a scanty vegetation, and not liable to
inundation. In such a place many pairs may be found, with nests thirty
or forty yards apart. The nest is sometimes placed at the foot of a tuft
of withered grass, at other times in an exposed situation. A cavity is
merely scooped out in the soil, and there are deposited in it four eggs,
which are in a great measure hatched by the heat which the sand acquires
under the influence of a summer sun; but in rough weather, and always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
by night, the female is careful to sit upon them. Her mate is extremely
attentive to her during the period of incubation, and should you happen
to stroll near the nest, you are sure to meet him at his station. The
eggs, which are four, and have their points placed together, measure
one inch and one-eighth by seven and a half eighths, are pyriform,
broad, and flatly rounded at the larger end, and tapering directly to
the smaller, which is also rounded. They are of a pale bluish-buff
colour, sprinkled and lined nearly all over with dark red, brown, and
black. Only one brood is raised in the season. The young, which go
abroad immediately after they are hatched, run with remarkable speed,
and, at the least note of the parent bird indicative of danger, squat so
closely on the sand, that you may walk over them without seeing them.
Their downy covering is grey mottled with brown; their bill almost
black. If taken up in the hand, they emit a soft plaintive note resembling
that of the old bird. The strange devices which their parents at
this time adopt to ensure their safety, cannot fail to render the student of
nature very unwilling to carry them off without urgent necessity. You
may see the mother, with expanded tail and wings trailing on the ground,
limping and fluttering before you, as if about to expire. It is true you
know it to be an artifice, but it is an artifice taught by maternal love;
and, when the bird has fairly got rid of her unwelcome visitor, and you
see her start up on her legs, stretch forth her wings, and fly away piping
her soft note, you cannot but participate in the joy that she feels.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this Plover is extremely rapid, as well as protracted.
It passes through the air by glidings and extended flappings, either close
over the sand, or high above the shores. On the ground, few birds are
swifter of foot: It runs in a straight line before you, sometimes for
twenty or thirty yards, with so much celerity, that unless you have a
keen eye, it is almost sure to become lost to your view. Then, in an instant
it stops, becomes perfectly motionless, and if it perceives that you
have not marked it, squats flat on the sand, which it so much resembles
in colour, that you may as well search for another, as try to find it again.
</p>

<p>
Their notes, which are so soft and mellow as nearly to resemble those
of the sweetest songster of the forest, reach your ear long before you have
espied the Piping Plover. Now and then, these sounds come from perhaps
twenty different directions, and you are perplexed, as well as delighted.
At the approach of autumn, this species becomes almost mute,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
the colour of the plumage fades; and it is then very difficult for you to
perceive one that may be only a few yards off, until it starts and runs or
flies before you. At this season they are less shy than before.
</p>

<p>
During winter they are generally in good condition, and their flesh is
very delicate and savoury, although, on account of their small size, they
seldom draw the sportsman after them. Their food consists of marine
insects, minute shell-fish, and small sand worms.

<h2>
THE WRECKERS OF FLORIDA.
</h2>

<p>
Long before I reached the lovely islets that border the south-eastern
shores of the Floridas, the accounts I had heard of “The Wreckers” had
deeply prejudiced me against them. Often had I been informed of the cruel
and cowardly methods which it was alleged they employed to allure vessels
of all nations to the dreaded reefs, that they might plunder their cargoes,
and rob their crews and passengers of their effects. I therefore
could have little desire to meet with such men under any circumstances,
much less to become liable to receive their aid; and with the name of
Wreckers, there were associated in my mind ideas of piratical depredation,
barbarous usage, and even murder.
</p>

<p>
One fair afternoon, while I was standing on the polished deck of the
United States’ revenue cutter the Marion, a sail hove in sight, bearing in
an opposite course, and “close-hauled” to the wind. The gentle rake of
her masts, as she rocked to and fro in the breeze, brought to my mind
the wavings of the reeds on the fertile banks of the Mississippi. By-and-by
the vessel altering her course, approached us. The Marion, like a
sea-bird, with extended wings, swept through the waters, gently inclining
to either side, while the unknown vessel leaped as it were from wave to
wave, like the dolphin in eager pursuit of his prey. In a short time, we
were gliding side by side, and the commander of the strange schooner saluted
our captain, who promptly returned the compliment. What a
beautiful vessel! we all thought; how trim, how clean-rigged, and how
well manned! She swims like a duck; and now with a broad sheer, off
she makes for the reefs, a few miles under our lee. There, in that narrow
passage, well known to her commander, she rolls, tumbles, and dances,
like a giddy thing, her copper sheathing now gleaming, and again disappearing
under the waves. But the passage is thrid, and now, hauling on
the wind, she resumes her former course, and gradually recedes from the
view. Reader, it was a Florida Wrecker!
</p>

<p>
When at the Tortugas, I paid a visit to several vessels of this kind, in
company with my excellent friend <span class="smcap">Robert Day</span>, Esq. We had observed
the regularity and quickness of the men then employed at their arduous
tasks, and as we approached the largest schooner, I admired her form so
well adapted to her occupation, her great breadth of beam, her light
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
draught, the correctness of her water-line, the neatness of her painted
sides, the smoothness of her well-greased masts, and the beauty of her
rigging. We were welcomed on board with all the frankness of our native
tars. Silence and order prevailed on her decks. The commander
and the second officer led us into a spacious cabin, well lighted, and furnished
with every convenience for fifteen or more passengers. The former
brought me his collection of marine shells, and whenever I pointed
to one that I had not seen before, offered it with so much kindness, that
I found it necessary to be careful in expressing my admiration of any particular
shell. He had also many eggs of rare birds, which were all handed
over to me, with an assurance that before the month should expire, a new
set could easily be procured, “for,” said he, “we have much idle time on
the reefs at this season.” Dinner was served, and we partook of their
fare, which consisted of fish, fowl, and other materials. These rovers,
who were both from “down east,” were stout active men, cleanly and
smart in their attire. In a short time, we were all extremely social and
merry. They thought my visit to the Tortugas, in quest of birds, was
rather “a curious fancy;” but, notwithstanding, they expressed their
pleasure while looking at some of my drawings, and offered their services
in procuring specimens. Expeditions far and near were proposed, and
on settling that one of them was to take place on the morrow, we parted
friends.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning, several of these kind men accompanied me to a
small key called Booby Island, about ten miles distant from the lighthouse.
Their boats were well manned, and rowed with long and steady
strokes, such as whalers and men-of-war’s men are wont to draw. The
captain sang, and at times, by way of frolic, ran a race with our own
beautiful bark. The Booby Isle was soon reached, and our sport there
was equal to any we had elsewhere. They were capital shots, had excellent
guns, and knew more about boobies and noddies than nine-tenths of
the best naturalists in the world. But what will you say when I tell you
that the Florida Wreckers are excellent at a deer hunt, and that at certain
seasons, “when business is slack,” they are wont to land on some extensive
key, and in a few hours procure a supply of delicious venison.
</p>

<p>
Some days afterwards, the same party took me on an expedition in
quest of sea-shells. There we were all in the water at times to the waist,
and now and then much deeper. Now they would dip, like ducks, and
on emerging would hold up a beautiful shell. This occupation they
seemed to enjoy above all others.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The duties of the Marion having been performed, intimation of our
intended departure reached the Wreckers. An invitation was sent to me
to go and see them on board their vessels, which I accepted. Their object
on this occasion was to present me with some superb corals, shells,
live turtles of the Hawk-billed species, and a great quantity of eggs. Not
a “pecayon” would they receive in return, but putting some letters in my
hands, requested me to “be so good as put them in the mail at Charleston,”
adding that they were for their wives “down east.” So anxious
did they appear to be to do all they could for me, that they proposed to
sail before the Marion, and meet her under weigh, to give me some birds
that were rare on the coast, and of which they knew the haunts. Circumstances
connected with “the service” prevented this, however; and
with sincere regret, and a good portion of friendship, I bade these excellent
fellows adieu. How different, thought I, is often the knowledge of
things acquired by personal observation, from that obtained by report!
</p>

<p>
I had never before seen Florida Wreckers, nor has it since been my
fortune to fall in with any; but my good friend, Dr <span class="smcap">Benjamin Strobel</span>,
having furnished me with a graphic account of a few days which he spent
with them, I shall present you with it in his own words.
</p>

<p>
“On the 12th day of September, while lying in harbour at Indian
Key, we were joined by five wrecking vessels. Their licences having expired,
it was necessary to go to Key West to renew them. We determined
to accompany them the next morning, and here it will not be amiss
for me to say a few words respecting these far-famed Wreckers, their
captains and crews. From all that I had heard, I expected to see a
parcel of dirty, pirate-looking vessels, officered and manned by a set of
black-whiskered fellows, who carried murder in their very looks. I was
agreeably surprised on discovering that the vessels were fine large sloops
and schooners, regular clippers, kept in first-rate order. The Captains
generally were jovial, good-humoured sons of Neptune, who manifested
a disposition to be polite and hospitable, and to afford every facility to
persons passing up and down the Reef. The crews were hearty, well-drest,
and honest-looking men.
</p>

<p>
“On the 13th, at the appointed hour, we all set sail together, that is,
the five Wreckers and the schooner Jane. As our vessel was not noted
for fast-sailing, we accepted an invitation to go on board of a Wrecker.
The fleet got under weigh about eight o’clock in the morning, the wind
light but fair, the water smooth, and the day fine. I can scarcely find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
words to express the pleasure and gratification which I this day experienced.
The sea was of a beautiful soft, pea-green colour, smooth as a
sheet of glass, and as transparent, its surface agitated only by our vessels
as they parted its bosom, or by the Pelican in pursuit of his prey, which
rising for a considerable distance in the air, would suddenly plunge down
with distended mandibles and secure his food. The vessels of our little
fleet, with every sail set that could catch a breeze, and the white foam
curling round the prows, glided silently along, like islands of flitting
shadows, on an immovable sea of light. Several fathoms below the surface
of the water, and under us, we saw great quantities of fish diving
and sporting among the sea-grass, sponges, sea-feathers, and corals, with
which the bottom was covered. On our right hand were the Florida
Keys, which, as we made them in the distance, looked like specks upon
the surface of the water, but as we neared them, rose to view as if by enchantment,
clad in the richest livery of spring, each variety of colour and
hue rendered soft and delicate by a clear sky and a brilliant sun over
head. All was like a fairy scene; my heart leaped up in delighted admiration,
and I could not but exclaim in the language of <span class="smcap">Scott</span>,
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i4">“Those seas behold,</p>
<p>Round thrice an hundred islands rolled.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="post">
The trade-wind played around us with balmy and refreshing sweetness;
and, to give life and animation to the scene, we had a contest for the
mastery between all the vessels of the fleet, while a deep interest was excited
in favour of this or that vessel, as she shot ahead, or fell astern.
</p>

<p>
About three o’clock in the afternoon, we arrived off the Bay of
Honda. The wind being light, and no prospect of reaching Key West
that night, it was agreed that we should make a harbour here. We
entered a beautiful basin and came to anchor about four o’clock. Boats
were got out, and several hunting parties formed. We landed, and were
soon on the scent, some going in search of shells, others of birds. An Indian,
who had been picked up somewhere along the coast by a Wrecker,
and who was employed as a hunter, was sent ashore in search of venison.
Previous to his leaving the vessel, a rifle was loaded with a single ball,
and put into his hands. After an absence of several hours, he returned
with two deer, which he had killed at a single shot. He watched until
they were both in range of his gun, side by side, when he fired and
brought them down.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
</p>

<p>
All hands having returned, and the fruits of our excursion being collected,
we had wherewithal to make an abundant supper. Most of the game
was sent on board the largest vessel, where we proposed supping. Our
vessels were all lying within hail of each other, and as soon as the moon
arose, boats were seen passing from vessel to vessel, and all were busily
and happily engaged in exchanging civilities. One could never have supposed
that these men were professional rivals, so apparent was the good-feeling
that prevailed among them. About nine o’clock we started for
supper; a number of persons had already collected, and as soon as we
arrived on board the vessel, a German sailor, who played remarkably well
on the violin, was summoned on the quarter-deck, when all hands, with a
good will, cheerily danced to lively airs until supper was ready. The
table was laid in the cabin, and groaned under its load of venison, wild
ducks, pigeons, curlews, and fish. Toasting and singing succeeded the
supper, and among other curious matters introduced, the following song
was sung by the German fiddler, who accompanied his voice with his instrument.
He is said to be the author of the song. I say nothing of
the poetry, but merely give it as it came on my ear. It is certainly very
characteristic.

Great emphasis was laid upon particular words by the singer, who

no unpleasant effect.

THE MALLARD.

</p>

<p>
Although it is commonly believed that the Mallard is found abundantly
everywhere in the United States, I have received sufficient proof
to the contrary. If authors had acknowledged that they state so on report,
or had said that in the tame state the bird is common, I should not
have blamed them. According to my observation, and I may be allowed
to say that I have had good opportunities, this valuable species is extremely
rare in the wild state, in the neighbourhood of Boston in Massachusetts;
and in this assertion, I am supported by my talented and
amiable friend Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, who has resided there for many years. Farther
eastward, this bird is so rare that it is scarcely known, and not one
was seen by myself or my party beyond Portland in Maine. On the
western coast of Labrador none of the inhabitants that we conversed with
had ever seen the Mallard, and in Newfoundland the people were equally
unacquainted with it, the species being in those countries replaced by the
Black Duck, <i>Anas fusca</i>. From New York southward, the Mallards
become more plentiful, and numbers of them are seen in the markets of
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Richmond in Virginia, and other towns. Although
they are very abundant in the Carolinas and Floridas, as well as
in Lower Louisiana, they are much more so in the Western Country.
The reason of this is merely that the Mallard, unlike the sea ducks, is
rarely seen on salt water, and that its course from the countries where it
chiefly breeds is across the interior of the continent. From our great
lakes, they spread along the streams, betake themselves to the ponds,
wet meadows, submersed savannahs, and inland swamps, and are even
found in the thick beech woods, in early autumn, and indeed long before
the males have acquired the dark green colour of the head. Many of
them proceed beyond the limits of the United States.
</p>

<p>
It would be curious to know when this species was first domesticated;
but, Reader, the solution of such a question is a task on which I shall
not venture. In the domestic state every body knows the Mallard.
When young it affords excellent food, and when old lays eggs. A bed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
made of its feathers is far preferable to the damp earth of the camp of an
American woodsman, or the plank on which the trained soldier lays his
wearied limbs at night. You may find many other particulars if you
consult in chronological order all the compilers from <span class="smcap">Aldrovandus</span> to
the present day.
</p>

<p>
Be not startled, good Reader, when I tell you that many of these
ducks are bred in the lakes near the Mississippi, nay even in some of the
small ponds in the low lands or bottoms of the States of Kentucky, Indiana
and Illinois; for in many parts of those districts I have surprised
the females on their eggs, have caught the young when their mother was
cautiously and with anxiety leading them for greater safety to some
stream, and have shot many a fat one before the poor thing could fly,
and when it was so plump, tender, and juicy, that I doubt much whether,
you, like myself, should not much prefer them to the famed Canvass-backed
Duck.
</p>

<p>
Look at that Mallard as he floats on the lake; see his elevated head
glittering with emerald-green, his amber eyes glancing in the light! Even
at this distance, he has marked you, and suspects that you bear no good
will towards him, for he sees that you have a gun, and he has many a
time been frightened by its report, or that of some other. The wary
bird draws his feet under his body, springs upon them, opens his wings,
and with loud quacks bids you farewell.
</p>

<p>
Now another is before you, on the margin of that purling streamlet.
How brisk are all his motions compared with those of his brethren that
waddle across your poultry-yard! how much more graceful in form and
neat in apparel! The duck at home is the descendant of a race of slaves,
and has lost his native spirit: his wings have been so little used that they
can hardly raise him from the ground. But the free-born, the untamed
duck of the swamps,—see how he springs on wing, and hies away over
the woods.
</p>

<p>
The Mallards generally arrive in Kentucky and other parts of the
Western Country, from the middle of September to the first of October,
or as soon as the acorns and beech-nuts are fully ripe. In a few days
they are to be found in all the ponds that are covered with seed-bearing
grasses. Some flocks, which appear to be guided by an experienced
leader, come directly down on the water with a rustling sound of their
wings that can be compared only to the noise produced by an Eagle in
the act of stooping upon its prey, while other flocks, as if they felt uneasy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
respecting the safety of the place, sweep around and above it several
times in perfect silence, before they alight. In either case, the
birds immediately bathe themselves, beat their bodies with their wings,
dive by short plunges, and cut so many capers that you might imagine
them to be stark mad. The fact, however, seems to be, that all this alacrity
and gaiety only shews the necessity they feel of clearing themselves
of the insects about their plumage, as well as the pleasure they experience
on finding themselves in a milder climate, with abundance of food around
them, after a hard journey of perhaps a day and a night. They wash
themselves and arrange their dress, before commencing their meal; and
in this other travellers would do well to imitate them.
</p>

<p>
Now, towards the grassy margins they advance in straggling parties.
See how they leap from the water to bend the loaded tops of the tall reeds.
Woe be to the slug or snail that comes in their way. Some are probing
the mud beneath, and waging war against the leech, frog, or lizard, that
is within reach of their bills; while many of the older birds run into the
woods, to fill their crops with beech-nuts and acorns, not disdaining to
swallow also, should they come in their way, some of the wood-mice that,
frightened by the approach of the foragers, hie towards their burrows.
The cackling they keep up would almost deafen you, were you near them;
but it is suddenly stopped by the approach of some unusual enemy, and
at once all are silent. With heads erected on out-stretched necks, they
anxiously look around. It is nothing, however, but a bear, who being,
like themselves, fond of mast, is ploughing up the newly fallen leaves
with his muzzle, or removing an old rotting log in search of worms. The
ducks resume their employment. But another sound is now heard, one
more alarming. The bear raises himself on his hind legs, snuffs the air,
and with a loud snort gallops off towards the depths of his cane-brake.
The ducks retreat to the water, betake themselves to the centre of the
pool, and uttering half-stifled notes await the sight of the object they
dread. There the enemy cunningly advances first covered by one tree,
then by another. He has lost his chance of the bear, but as he is pushed
by hunger, a Mallard will do for the bullet of his rusty rifle. It is an
Indian, as you perceive by his red skin and flowing black hair, which,
however, has been cut close from the sides of his head. In the centre of
his dearly purchased blanket, a hole has been cut, through which he has
thrust his bare head, and the ragged garment, like a horse’s netting, is
engaged as it were in flapping off the last hungry musquitoes of the season
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
that are fast sucking the blood from his limbs. Watch him, Mallard,
Nay, wait no longer, for I see him taking aim; better for you all to fly!
No—well, one of you will certainly furnish him with a repast. Amid the
dark wood rises the curling smoke, the report comes on my ear, the ducks
all rise save a pair, that, with back downwards and feet kicking against
the air, have been hit by the prowler. The free son of the forest slowly
approaches the pool, judges at a glance of the depth of the mire, and
boldly advances, until with a cane he draws the game towards him. Returning
to the wood, he now kindles a little fire, the feathers fill the air
around; from each wing he takes a quill, to clean the touch-hole of his
gun in damp weather; the entrails he saves to bait some trap. In a short
time the ducks are ready, and the hunter enjoys his meal, although brief
time does he take in swallowing the savoury morsels. Soon, the glimmering
light of the moon will see him again on his feet, and lead him through
the woods, as he goes in pursuit of other game.
</p>

<p>
The Mallards that remain with us during the whole year, and breed
on the banks of the Mississippi or Lake Michigan, or in the beautiful
meadows that here and there border the Schuylkil in Pennsylvania, begin
to pair in the very heart of winter; and although ducks are quite destitute
of song, their courtships are not devoid of interest. The males, like
other gay deceivers, offer their regards to the first fair one that attracts
their notice, promise unremitting fidelity and affection, and repeat their
offers to the next they meet. See that drake, how he proudly shews, first
the beauty of his silky head, then the brilliancy of his wing-spots, and, with
honeyed jabberings, discloses the warmth of his affection. He plays around
this one, then around another, until the passion of jealousy is aroused in
the breasts of the admired and flattered. Bickerings arise; the younger
duck disdains her elder sister, and a third, who conceives herself a coquette
of the first order, interposes, as if to ensure the caresses of the
feathered beau. Many tricks are played by ducks, good Reader, but
ere long, the females retire in search of a safe place in which they may
deposit their eggs and rear their young. They draw a quantity of weed
around them, and form an ill-arranged sort of nest, in which from seven
to ten eggs are laid. From their bodies they pluck the softest down, and
placing it beneath the eggs, begin the long process of incubation, which
they intermit only for short periods, when it becomes absolutely necessary
to procure a little sustenance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At length, in about three weeks, the young began to cheep in the
shell, from which, after a violent struggle, they make their escape. What
beautiful creatures! See how, with their little bills, they dry their
downy apparel! Now in a long line, one after another, they follow their
glad mother to the water, on arriving at which they take to swimming
and diving, as if elated with joy for having been introduced into existence.
The male, wearied and emaciated, is far away on some other pond.
The unnatural barbarian cares nothing about his progeny, nor has a
thought arisen in his mind respecting the lonely condition of his mate,
the greatness of her cares, or the sadness that she may experience under
the idea that she has been utterly forsaken by him who once called her
his only and truly beloved. No, Reader, not a thought of this kind has
he wasted on her whom he has left alone in charge of a set of eggs, and
now of a whole flock of innocent ducklings, to secure which from danger,
and see them all grow up apace, she manifests the greatest care and
anxiety. She leads them along the shallow edges of grassy ponds, and
teaches them to seize the small insects that abound there, the flies, the
musquitoes, the giddy beetles that skim along the surface in circles and
serpentine lines. At the sight of danger they run as it were on the water,
make directly for the shore, or dive and disappear. In about six weeks,
those that have escaped from the ravenous fishes and turtles have attained
a goodly size; the quills appear on their wings; their bodies are encased
with feathers; but as yet none are able to fly. They now procure their
food by partial immersions of the head and neck in the manner of the old
bird. At this period they are already fit for the table, and delicate as
well as savoury food they afford. By the time that the leaves are changing
their hues, the young Mallards take freely to their wings, and the old
males join the congregated flocks.
</p>

<p>
The Squatters of the Mississippi raise a considerable number of Mallards,
which they catch when quite young, and which, after the first year,
are as tame as they can wish. These birds raise broods which are superior
even to those of the wild ones, for a year or two, after which they
become similar to the ordinary ducks of the poultry-yard. The hybrids
produced between the Mallard and the Muscovy Duck are of great size,
and afford excellent eating. Some of these half-breeds now and then
wander off, become quite wild, and have by some persons been considered
as forming a distinct species. They also breed, when tame, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
Black Duck (<i>Anas fusca</i>) and the Gadwal, the latter connection giving
rise to a very handsome hybrid, retaining the yellow feet and barred plumage
of the one, and the green head of the other parent.
</p>

<p>
I have found the Mallard breeding on large prostrate and rotten logs,
three feet above the ground, and in the centre of a cane-brake, nearly a
mile distant from any water. Once I found a female leading her young
through the woods, and no doubt conducting them towards the Ohio.
When I first saw her, she had already observed me, and had squatted
flat among the grass, with her brood around her. As I moved onwards,
she ruffled her feathers, and hissed at me in the manner of a goose, while
the little ones scampered off in all directions. I had an excellent dog,
well instructed to catch young birds without injuring them, and I ordered
him to seek for them. On this the mother took to wing, and flew through
the woods as if about to fall down at every yard or so. She passed and
repassed over the dog, as if watching the success of his search; and as
one after another the ducklings were brought to me, and struggled in my
bird-bag, the distressed parent came to the ground near me, rolled and
tumbled about, and so affected me by her despair, that I ordered my dog
to lie down, while, with a pleasure that can be felt only by those who are
parents themselves, I restored to her the innocent brood, and walked off.
As I turned round to observe her, I really thought I could perceive gratitude
expressed in her eye; and a happier moment I never felt while
rambling in search of knowledge through the woods.
</p>

<p>
In unfrequented parts, the Mallards feed both by day and by night;
but in places where they are much disturbed by gunners, they feed mostly
by night, or towards evening and about sunrise. In extremely cold
weather, they betake themselves to the sources of streams, and even to
small springs, where they may be found along with the American Snipe.
At times, after heavy falls of rain, they are seen searching for ground-worms
over the corn-fields, and during the latter part of autumn, the
rice plantations of Georgia and the Carolinas afford them excellent pasture
grounds. I have thought indeed that at this season these birds perform
a second migration as it were, for they then pour into the rice-fields
by thousands from the interior. In the Floridas, they are at times seen
in such multitudes as to darken the air, and the noise they make in rising
from off a large submersed savannah, is like the rumbling of thunder. So
numerous were the Mallards while I was at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s in
East Florida, that a single Negro whom that gentleman kept as a hunter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
would shoot from fifty to a hundred and twenty in a day, thus supplying
the plantation with excellent food.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Mallard is swift, strong, and well sustained. It rises
either from the ground or from the water at a single spring, and flies almost
perpendicularly for ten or fifteen yards, or, if in a thick wood, until
quite above the tops of the tallest trees, after which it moves horizontally.
If alarmed, it never rises without uttering several <i>quacks</i>; but on other
occasions it usually leaves its place in silence. While travelling to any
distance; the whistling sound of their wings may be heard a great way off,
more especially in the quiet of night. Their progress through the air I
have thought might be estimated at a mile and a half in the minute; and
I feel very confident that when at full speed and on a long journey, they
can fly at the rate of a hundred and twenty miles in the hour.
</p>

<p>
The Mallard is truly omnivorous, its food consisting of every thing
that can possibly satisfy the cravings of its extraordinary appetite. Nor
is it at all cleanly in this respect, for it will swallow any kind of offals,
and feed on all sorts of garbage, even putrid fish, as well as on snakes
and small quadrupeds. Nuts and fruits of all kinds are dainties to it,
and it soon fattens on rice, corn, or any other grain. My friend <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span>, who usually raises a great number of Mallards every year, has
the young fed on chopped fish, on which they thrive uncommonly well.
So very greedy are these birds, that I have often observed a couple of
them tugging for a long time against each other for the skin of an eel,
which was already half swallowed by the one, while the other was engaged
at the opposite end. They are expert fly-catchers, and are in the
habit of patting with their feet the damp earth, to force ground-worms
out of their burrows.
</p>

<p>
Besides man, the enemies of the Mallard are the White-headed Eagle,
the Snowy Owl, the Virginian Owl, the racoon, the lynx, and the snapping
turtle. Mallards are easily caught by snares, steel-traps baited with
corn, and figure-of-four traps. As we have no decoys in the United
States, I shall not trouble you with a new edition of the many accounts
you will find in ornithological books of that destructive method of procuring
Wild Ducks.
</p>

<p>
The eggs of this species measure two inches and a quarter in length,
one inch and five-eighths in breadth. The shell is smooth, and of a plain
light dingy green. They are smaller than those of the tame duck, and
rarely so numerous. As soon as incubation commences, the males associate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
together in flocks, until the young are able to migrate. This species
raises only one brood in the season, and I never found its nest with
eggs in autumn. The female covers her eggs before she leaves them to
go in search of food, and thus keeps them sufficiently warm until her return.

THE WHITE IBIS.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ibis alba</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXII. Adult Male, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
Sandy Island, of which I have already spoken in my second volume,
is remarkable as a breeding-place for various species of water and land
birds. It is about a mile in length, not more than a hundred yards broad,
and in form resembles a horse-shoe, the inner curve of which looks toward
Cape Sable in Florida, from which it is six miles distant. At low water,
it is surrounded to a great distance by mud flats abounding in food for
wading and swimming birds, while the plants, the fruits, and the insects
of the island itself, supply many species that are peculiar to the land.
Besides the White Ibis, we found breeding there the Brown Pelican, the
Purple, the Louisiana, the White, and the Green Herons, two species of
Gallinule, the Cardinal Grosbeak, Crows, and Pigeons. The vegetation
consists of a few tall mangroves, thousands of wild plum trees, several
species of cactus, some of them nearly as thick as a man’s body, and
more than twenty feet high, different sorts of smilax, grape-vines, cane,
palmettoes, Spanish bayonets, and the rankest nettles I ever saw,—all so
tangled together, that I leave you to guess how difficult it was for my
companions and myself to force a passage through them in search of birds’
nests, which, however, we effected, although the heat was excessive, and
the stench produced by the dead birds, putrid eggs, and the natural effluvia
of the Ibises, was scarcely sufferable. But then, the White Ibis
was there, and in thousands; and, although I already knew the bird, I
wished to study its manners once more, that I might be enabled to present
you with an account of them, which I now proceed to do,—endeavouring
all the while to forget the pain of the numerous scratches and lacerations
of my legs caused by the cactuses of Sandy Island.
</p>

<p>
As we entered that well-known place, we saw nests on every bush,
cactus, or tree. Whether the number was one thousand or ten I cannot
say, but this I well know:—I counted forty-seven on a single plum-tree.
These nests of the White Ibis measure about fifteen inches in their greatest
diameter, and are formed of dry twigs intermixed with fibrous roots
and green branches of the trees growing on the island, which this bird
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
easily breaks with its bill; the interior, which is flat, being finished with
leaves of the cane and some other plants. The bird breeds only once in
the year, and the full number of its eggs is three. They measure two
inches and a quarter in length, with a diameter of one inch and five-eighths,
are rough to the touch, although not granulated, of a dull white
colour, blotched with pale yellow, and irregularly spotted with deep reddish-brown.
They afford excellent eating, although when boiled they do not look
inviting, the white resembling a livid-coloured jelly, and the yolk being of a
reddish-orange, the former wonderfully transparent, instead of being opaque
like that of most other birds. The eggs are deposited from the 10th of April
to the 1st of May, and incubation is general by the 10th of the latter month.
The young birds, which are at first covered with thick down of a dark
grey colour, are fed by regurgitation. They take about five weeks to be
able to fly, although they leave the nest at the end of three weeks, and
stand on the branches, or on the ground, waiting the arrival of their parents
with food, which consists principally of small fiddler crabs and crayfish.
On some occasions, I have found them at this age miles away from
the breeding-places, and in this state they are easily caught. As soon as
the young are able to provide for themselves, the old birds leave them,
and the different individuals are then seen searching for food apart.
While nestling or in the act of incubating, these Ibises are extremely gentle
and unwary, unless they may have been much disturbed, for they almost
allow you to touch them on the nest. The females are silent all the
while, but the males evince their displeasure by uttering sounds which
greatly resemble those of the White-headed Pigeon, and which may be
imitated by the syllables <i>crooh, croo, croo</i>. The report of a gun scarcely
alarms them at first, although at all other periods these birds are shy and
vigilant in the highest degree.
</p>

<p>
The change in the colouring of the bill, legs, and feet of this bird,
that takes place in the breeding-season, is worthy of remark, the bill being
then of a deep orange red, and the legs and feet of a red nearly
amounting to carmine. The males at this season have the gular pouch
of a rich orange colour, and somewhat resembling in shape that of the
Frigate Pelican, although proportionally less. During winter, these parts
are of a dull flesh colour. The irides also lose much of their clear blue,
and resume in some degree the umber colour of the young birds. I am
thus particular in these matters, because it is doubtful if any one else has
ever paid attention to them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
</p>

<p>
While breeding, the White Ibises go to a great distance in search of
food for their young, flying in flocks of several hundreds. Their excursions
take place at particular periods, determined by the decline of the tides,
when all the birds that are not sitting go off, perhaps twenty or thirty
miles, to the great mud flats, where they collect abundance of food, with
which they return the moment the tide begins to flow. As the birds of
this genus feed by night as well as by day, the White Ibis attends the
tides at whatever hour they may be. Some of those which bred on Sandy
Key would go to the keys next the Atlantic, more than forty miles distant,
while others made for the Ever Glades; but they never went off
singly. They rose with common accord from the breeding-ground, forming
themselves into long lines, often a mile in extent, and soon disappeared
from view. Soon after the turn of the tide we saw them approaching
in the same order. Not a note could you have heard on those occasions;
yet if you disturb them when far from their nests, they utter loud hoarse
cries resembling the syllables <i>hunk, hunk, hunk</i>, either while on the ground
or as they fly off.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the White Ibis is rapid and protracted. Like all other
species of the genus, these birds pass through the air with alternate flappings
and sailings; and I have thought that the use of either mode depended
upon the leader of the flock, for, with the most perfect regularity,
each individual follows the motion of that preceding it, so that a constant
appearance of regular undulations is produced through the whole line.
If one is shot at this time, the whole line is immediately broken up, and for
a few minutes all is disorder; but as they continue their course, they
soon resume their former arrangement. The wounded bird never attempts
to bite or to defend itself in any manner, although, if only winged,
it runs off with more speed than is pleasant to its pursuer.
</p>

<p>
At other times the White Ibis, like the Red and the Wood Ibises,
rises to an immense height in the air, where it performs beautiful evolutions.
After they have thus, as it were, amused themselves for some
time, they glide down with astonishing speed, and alight either on trees
or on the ground. Should the sun be shining, they appear in their full
beauty, and the glossy black tips of their wings form a fine contrast with
the yellowish-white of the rest of their plumage.
</p>

<p>
This species is as fond of resorting to the ponds, bayous, or lakes that
are met with in the woods, as the Wood Ibis itself. I have found it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
breeding there at a distance of more than three hundred miles from the
sea, and remaining in the midst of the thickest forests until driven off to
warmer latitudes by the approach of winter. This is the case in the
State of Mississippi, not far from Natchez, and in all the swampy forests
around Bayou Sara and Pointe Coupée, as well as the interior of the
Floridas. When disturbed in such places, these Ibises fly at once to the
tops of the tallest trees, emitting their hoarse <i>hunk</i>, and watch your motions
with so much care that it is extremely difficult to get within shot
of them.
</p>

<p>
The manner in which this bird searches for its food is very curious.
The Woodcock and the Snipe, it is true, are probers as well as it, but
their task requires less ingenuity than is exercised by the White or the
Red Ibis. It is also true that the White Ibis frequently seizes on small
crabs, slugs and snails, and even at times on flying insects; but its usual
mode of procuring food is a strong proof that cunning enters as a principal
ingredient in its instinct. The Cray-fish often burrows to the depth
of three or four feet in dry weather, for before it can be comfortable it
must reach the water. This is generally the case during the prolonged
heats of summer, at which time the White Ibis is most pushed for food.
The bird, to procure the Cray-fish, walks with remarkable care towards
the mounds of mud which the latter throws up while forming its hole, and
breaks up the upper part of the fabric, dropping the fragments into the
deep cavity that has been made by the animal. Then the Ibis retires a
single step, and patiently waits the result. The Cray-fish, incommoded
by the load of earth, instantly sets to work anew, and at last reaches the
entrance of its burrow; but the moment it comes in sight, the Ibis seizes
it with his bill.
</p>

<p>
Whilst at Indian Key, I observed an immense quantity of beautiful
tree snails, of a pyramidal or shortly conical form, some pure white,
others curiously marked with spiral lines of bright red, yellow and black.
They were crawling vigorously on every branch of each bush where
there was not a nest of the White Ibis; but wherever that bird had
fixed its habitation, not a live snail was to be seen, although hundreds
lay dead beneath. Was this caused by the corrosive quality of the bird’s
ordure?
</p>

<p>
There is a curious though not altogether general difference between
the sexes of this species as to the plumage:—the male has five of its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
primaries tipped with glossy black for several inches, while the female,
which is very little smaller than the male, has only four marked in this
manner. On examining more than a hundred individuals of each sex, I
found only four exceptions, which occurred in females that were very old
birds, and which, as happens in some other species, might perhaps have
been undergoing the curious change exhibited by ducks, pheasants, and
some other birds, the females of which when old sometimes assume the
livery of the males.
</p>

<p>
Much, as you are aware, good Reader, has been said respecting the
“oil bags” of birds. I dislike controversy, simply because I never saw
the least indications of it in the ways of the Almighty Creator. Should
I err, forgive me, but my opinion is, that these organs were not made
without an object. Why should they consist of matter so conveniently
placed, and so disposed as to issue under the least pressure, through apertures
in the form of well defined tubes? The White Ibis, as well as the
Wood Ibis, and all the other species of this genus, when in full health,
has these oil bags of great size, and, if my eyes have not deceived me,
makes great use of their contents. Should you feel anxious to satisfy
yourself on this subject, I request of you to keep some Ibises alive for
several weeks, as I have done, and you will have an opportunity of judging.
And again, tell me if the fat contained in these bags is not the very
best <i>lip-salve</i> that can be procured.
</p>

<p>
When any species of Ibis with which I am acquainted falls into the
water on being wounded, it swims tolerably well; but I have never observed
any taking to the water and swimming either by choice or to escape
pursuit. While in the company of Mr <span class="smcap">Joseph Mason</span>, a young man who
was for some time employed by me, and who has drawn plants to some of
my birds, although not so successfully as my amiable friend Miss <span class="smcap">Martin</span>,
or <span class="smcap">George Lehman</span>, who finish those they draw as beautifully as my learned
and valued friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span> of Edinburgh does his
faithful drawings of birds, I chanced one morning to be on the look-out for
White Ibises, in a delightful swamp not many miles from Bayou Sara. It
was in the end of summer, and all around was pure and calm as the clear
sky, the bright azure of which was reflected by the lake before us. The
trees had already exchanged the verdure of their foliage for more mellow
tints of diversified hue; the mast dropped from the boughs; some of the
Warblers had begun to think of removing farther south; the Night Hawk,
in company with the Chimney Swallow, was passing swiftly towards the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
land of their winter residence, and the Ibises had all departed for the
Florida coasts, excepting a few of the white species, one of which we at
length espied. It was perched about fifty yards from us towards the
centre of the pool, and as the report of one of our guns echoed among the
tall cypresses, down to the water, broken-winged, it fell. The exertions
which it made to reach the shore seemed to awaken the half-torpid alligators
that lay in the deep mud at the bottom of the pool. One shewed
his head above the water, then a second and a third. All gave chase to
the poor wounded bird, which, on seeing its dreaded and deadly foes,
made double speed towards the very spot where we stood. I was surprised
to see how much faster the bird swam than the reptiles, who, with
jaws widely opened, urged their heavy bodies through the water. The
Ibis was now within a few yards of us. It was the alligator’s last chance.
Springing forward as it were, he raised his body almost out of the water;
his jaws nearly touched the terrified bird; when pulling three triggers at
once, we lodged the contents of our guns in the throat of the monster.
Thrashing furiously with his tail, and rolling his body in agony, the alligator
at last sunk to the mud; and the Ibis, as if in gratitude, walked to
our very feet, and there lying down, surrendered itself to us. I kept this
bird until the succeeding spring, and by care and good nursing, had the
pleasure of seeing its broken wing perfectly mended, when, after its long
captivity, I restored it to liberty, in the midst of its loved swamps and
woods.
</p>

<p>
The young bird of this species which I kept alive for some time, fed
freely, after a few days captivity, on soaked Indian corn meal, but evinced
great pleasure when cray-fishes were offered to it. On seizing one, it beat
it sideways on the ground, until the claws and legs were broken off, after
which it swallowed the body whole. It was fond of lying on its side in
the sun for an hour or so at a time, pluming its body and nursing the
sore wing. It walked lightly and very gracefully, though not so much
so as the Herons. It did not molest its companions, and became very
gentle and tame, following those who fed it like a common fowl.
</p>

<p>
The Creoles of Louisiana call this species “<i>Bee croche</i>,” and also
“<i>Petit Flaman</i>,” though it is also generally known by the name of
“Spanish Curlew.” The flesh, which, as well as the skin, is of a dull
orange colour, is extremely fishy, although the birds are often sold in
our southernmost markets, and are frequently eaten by the Indians.
</p>

<p>
The White Ibis has been shot eastward as far as New Jersey. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
this I have been made aware by my generous friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>,

<h2>
THE AMERICAN OYSTER-CATCHER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Hæmatopus palliatus</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXIII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Our Oyster-Catcher has a very extensive range. It spends the winter
along the coast from Maryland to the Gulf of Mexico, and being then
abundant on the shores of the Floridas, may be considered a constant
resident in the United States. At the approach of spring, it removes toward
the Middle States, where, as well as in North Carolina, it breeds. It
seems scarcer between Long Island and Portland in Maine, where you
again see it, and whence it occurs all the way to Labrador, in which country
I found that several were breeding in the month of July. Unless in
winter, when these birds assemble in parties of twenty-five or thirty individuals,
they are seldom met with in greater numbers than from one to
four pairs, with their families, which appear to remain with the parent
birds until the following spring. It is never found inland, nor even far
up our largest rivers, but is fond of remaining at all times on the sandy
beaches and rocky shores of our salt-water bays or marshes. In Labrador,
I met with it farther from the open sea than in any other part, yet
always near salt-water. I have never met with any other species on the
coasts of North America.
</p>

<p>
Shy, vigilant, and ever on the alert, the Oyster-Catcher walks with a
certain appearance of dignity, greatly enhanced by its handsome plumage
and remarkable bill. If you stop to watch it, that instant it sounds a
loud shrill note of alarm; and should you advance farther towards it,
when it has neither nest nor young, off it flies quite out of sight. Few
birds, indeed, are more difficult to be approached, and the only means of
studying its habits I found to be the use of an excellent telescope, with
which I could trace its motions when at the distance of a quarter of a
mile, and pursuing its avocations without apprehension of danger. In
this manner I have seen it probe the sand to the full length of its bill,
knock off limpets from the rocks on the coast of Labrador, using its weapon
sideways and insinuating it between the rock and the shell like a
chisel, seize the bodies of gaping oysters on what are called in the Southern
States and the Floridas “Racoon oyster beds,” and at other times
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
take up a “razor-handle” or solen, and lash it against the sands until the
shell was broken and the contents swallowed. Now and then they seem
to suck the sea-urchins, driving in the mouth, and introducing their bill
by the aperture, without breaking the shell; again they are seen wading
up to their bodies from one place to another, seizing on shrimps and
other crustacea, and even swimming for a few yards, should this be
necessary to enable them to remove from one bank to another without
flying. Small crabs, fiddlers, and sea-worms, are also caught by it, the
shells of which in a broken state I have found in its gizzard in greater or
less quantity. Frequently, while on wet sea-beaches, it pats the sand, to
force out the insects; and in one instance I saw an individual run from
the water to the dry sand, with a small flounder in its bill, which it afterwards
devoured.
</p>

<p>
This bird forms no regular nest, but is contented with scratching the
dry sand above high-water mark, so as to form a slight hollow, in which
it deposits its eggs. On the coast of Labrador, and in the Bay of
Fundy, it lays its eggs on the bare rock. When the eggs are on sand,
it seldom sits on them during the heat of the sun; but in Labrador, it
was found sitting as closely as any other bird. Here, then, is another
instance of the extraordinary difference of habit in the same bird under different
circumstances. It struck me so much that had I not procured a
specimen in Labrador, and another in our Middle Districts, during the
breeding season, and found them on the closest examination to be the
same, I should perhaps have thought the birds different. Everywhere,
however, I observed that this bird is fond of places covered with broken
shells and drifted sea-weeds or grasses, as a place of security for its eggs,
and where, in fact, it is no very easy matter to discover them. The eggs
are two or three, measure two inches and one-eighth in length, by an inch
and a half in breadth, and are of the form of those of a common hen.
They are of a pale cream colour, spotted with irregular marks of brownish-black,
and others of a paler tint, pretty equally dispersed all over.
The birds, even when not sitting on them, are so very anxious about them,
that on the least appearance of an enemy, they scream out loudly, and if
you approach the nest, fly over and around you, although always at a
considerable distance. When you meet with the young, which run as
soon as they are hatched, the old birds manifest the greatest anxiety.
They run before you, or fly around you, with great swiftness, and emit
peculiar notes, which at once induce their little ones to squat among the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
sand and broken shells, where, on account of their dull greyish-colour, it
is very difficult to see them unless you pass within a foot or two of them,
when they run off emitting a plaintive note, which renders the parents
doubly angry. Their shape is now almost round, and the streaks of
their back and rump, as well as the curved points of their bills, might induce
you to believe them to be any thing but the young of an Oyster-Catcher.
I have caught some, which I thought were more than a month
old, and yet were unable to fly, although full feathered. They appeared
weakened by their fatness, and were overtaken by running after them on the
sands. There were no parent birds near or in sight of them; yet I much
doubt if they procured their own food at this period, and have more reason
to believe that, like some other species of birds, they were visited and
supplied with food at particular hours of the day or of the night, as is the
case with Herons and Ibises, for the Oyster-Catcher is scarcely nocturnal.
</p>

<p>
By the beginning of October these birds return to the south. I saw
them at Labrador until the 11th of August, but cannot say at what period
they leave that country. When wounded while wading or on the shore,
they make for the water, on which they float buoyantly and move with ease.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the American Oyster-catcher is powerful, swift, elegant
at times, and greatly protracted. While they are on wing, their beauties
are as effectually displayed as those of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker
of our woods, the colours of which are somewhat similar. The transparent
white of their wings contrasts with their jetty tips, and is enriched
by the coral hue of the bill, while the beautiful white of their lower parts
has a very pleasing effect. Their loud cries, too, of <i>wheep, wheep, wheeop</i>,
which sound in your ears, are quite different from any you have heard; and
as they perform their various evolutions, all charming in themselves, you
cannot, if unacquainted with the bird, refrain from asking what it is?
Now wheeling with wonderful impetuosity, they pass within a hundred
yards of you, and suddenly checking their flight return, not low over
the waters as before, but high in the air. Again, they form their ranks
in a broad front, and again, as if suddenly alarmed by the report of a
distant gun, they close pell-mell, and dip towards the sands or the waters.
Shoot one at such a moment, and you may expect to kill another; but
as this is done, the wary birds, as if suddenly become aware of your intentions,
form themselves into a straggling line, and before a minute has
elapsed, far beyond reach, and fading on the view, are the remaining
Oyster-catchers.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The gullet of this species is capable of being considerably distended.
When your finger is introduced into it, it passes with ease into a sort of
crop, where the food is apparently prepared before entering the gizzard,
which is rather muscular. How this bird disposes of the hard particles
of shells, pebbles, and other matters, with which its food is mixed, is beyond
my comprehension, and one which I gladly leave for your solution.
Their flesh is dark, tough, and unfit for eating, unless in cases of extreme
necessity.
</p>

<p>
The females and young are dark olive-brown above, like the males,
but of a browner shade. I have represented a male bird. I have never
met with the European Oyster-catcher, <i>Hæmatopus Ostralegus</i>, in any
part of the United States, and, although I cannot of course aver that it
does not occur there, I believe that the American or Mantled Oyster-catcher
has been confounded with it by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> and others. Indeed,
the figure given by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> resembles that of the European bird, but
his description of the female and young almost agrees with the present
species, the dimensions also being nearly the same.

<h2>
THE KITTIWAKE GULL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Larus tridactylus</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXIV. Adult in Summer, and Young in Winter.</span>
</p>

<p>
This beautiful Gull ranges, during the autumnal and winter months,
along the whole of our extensive coasts. I have procured it from the
mouth of the Mississippi to the coast of Maine, and have traced it from
the latter district to Labrador. Yet I never saw it on any of our great
lakes or rivers, nor in any part of the interior. From New York to Eastport
it is extremely abundant, and many breed on the Island of Grand
Manan, off the entrance of the Bay of Fundy.
</p>

<p>
As we approached the famous Gannet Rock of the Gulf of St Lawrence,
the wind suddenly rose to a gale; but as I was exceedingly anxious
that a landing should be effected on the island, every exertion was made
to enable me to accomplish my purpose. The whale boat was manned.
<span class="smcap">Thomas Lincoln</span> and my son leaped into it, accompanied by young
<span class="smcap">Cooledge</span>. Urged by strong pulls, the buoyant boat advanced towards
the grim rock. For nearly an hour it became hidden from my sight; but
now and then the report of a gun brought intimation that all was as yet
safe; and at length I had the great pleasure of seeing it advancing towards
the Ripley, which stood off and on, shivering as it were under the
heavy blast. My eye fixed to the telescope, watched every movement of
the boat, as with fear I saw it tossed from billow to billow, this moment
a glimpse of her keel appearing over the edge of a wave, the next a foot
of her stem only seeming to float on the waters. “Pull steadily on, my
good lads,” at last came on my ear, when, by a heavy surge, the floating
shell was driven back some twenty yards, as I thought, and the wave,
foaming with wrath, broke over her. Breathless and exhausted, the crew
at length came within reach of a line, as the boat was dangerously plunging,
when by good luck the rope was thrown across her, and in a few moments
she lay snug under our lee. How happy was I when I again saw
my son, my young companions, and the sailors, on the deck of the Ripley.
Quickly was the whaler hauled on board, and with joy we saw our vessel
fly off like a Kittiwake before the gale.
</p>

<p>
When the anxiety was over, inquiries were made as to the success of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
adventurous party. Several nests of the Kittiwake and many of its eggs
had been brought safe on board. Notes had been taken on the spot, and
the result of the expedition was as follows:—The nests were found placed
on some ledge of the huge rock, so small as barely to admit their breadth,
which was about a foot. They were placed where no other bird than the
Guillemot would have ventured to drop its egg, or the Raven to fix his
nest. Yet on that narrow platform the Kittiwake sat on its three eggs,
as unconcerned as if in a meadow. The nests were altogether composed
of sea-weeds called “eel-grass,” and coarse grasses, probably procured on
the top of the rock, or stolen from the nest of some unwary Solan Goose.
Their inner surface was quite flat, although some of the nests were many
inches in thickness, and looked as if they had been increased in bulk year
after year. The sitting birds remained on their eggs with uncommon
pertinacity, seldom indeed flying off, but merely moving aside. The
male birds, or those that had no eggs, on the contrary, were extremely
clamorous, flew around the party in great concern, and shewed much courage.
The eggs are of a light olive-green colour, marked with numerous
irregular spots of dark brown. Their average length is two inches and a
quarter, their greatest breadth one inch and seven-eighths. No other
species of Gull was seen about the rock; and indeed I have regularly observed
that each species of this genus breeds far apart, although at all
other seasons it may associate with others.
</p>

<p>
The young remain a considerable time in the nest or about it, when
room is afforded. Their bills and feet are now quite black, the eye dark,
and they do not change these colours until the second spring after their
birth, when the bill is dull yellow, the legs and feet of a greenish flesh-colour,
and these parts gradually improve in their tints until they acquire
the appearance represented in the plate. This species raises only one
brood in the season, and old and young leave the coast of Labrador at
the first appearance of winter, or when the Ivory Gull reaches that country.
This, however, I know only from hearsay, having received the information
from a settler at Bras d’Or, who has lived there many years,
and must know something of both species, as he was in the habit of salting
young Kittiwakes for winter provisions, along with those of other species,
and of shooting the Ivory Gull when it arrived over his harbour in
the month of December.
</p>

<p>
The Kittiwake is on land the most awkward of its tribe; and, although
it walks often on the rocks, its gait manifests a waddling gaucherie; but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
on the water, or in the air, few birds surpass it in buoyancy, grace, and
ease of motion. Bearing up against the heaviest gale, it passes from one
trough of the sea to another, as if anxious to rest for an instant under the
lee of the billows; yet as these are seen to rear their curling crests, the
Gull is already several feet above them, and preparing to plunge into the
next hollow. While in our harbour, and during fine weather, they seemed
to play with their companions of other species. Now with a spiral curve,
they descend toward the water, support themselves by beats of their wings,
decline their heads, and pick up a young herring or some bit of garbage,
when away they fly, chased perhaps by several others anxious to rob them
of the prize. Noon has arrived. High above the mast-head of our tallest
man-of-war, the Kittiwakes float gracefully in wide circles, until all,
as if fatigued, sail downward again with common accord towards the
transparent deep, and, alighting close to each other, seem to ride safely at
anchor. There they now occupy themselves in cleaning and arranging
their beautiful plumage.
</p>

<p>
The food of this species consists of small fish, sea insects, and small
bivalves, most of which they procure while on wing, even those left dry
by the tide. Unlike the larger species, they do not take up shell-fish to
break them by letting them fall on the rocks; at least I never saw them
do so. Their principal enemies are different species of Lestris, especially
that beautiful one named the <i>L. parasiticus</i>. This tormentor follows the
Kittiwake to the very waters around the Gulf of Florida during the
winter. There with astonishing swiftness, and an audacity scarcely to be
surpassed, it gives chase to the Gull, overtakes it, and forces it to alight
on the water, or to disgorge the fish which it has just swallowed.
</p>

<p>
The two represented in the plate were drawn at Boston, at the approach
of spring, when the old birds had already assumed the pure white
of the head. This species was so abundant on several of the islands of
the Bay of Boston, that several basketfuls of them were procured in the
course of a few excursions. When one fell to the water, the rest would
hover about and around the boat, until many were shot from a flock.
The case was the same, while we were in some of the harbours of Labrador.

<h2>
THE KILDEER PLOVER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Charadrius vociferus</i>, Wils.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
Reader, suppose yourself wandering over some extensive prairie, far
beyond the western shores of the Mississippi. While your wearied limbs
and drooping spirits remind you of the necessity of repose and food, you
see the moon’s silvery rays glitter on the dews that have already clothed the
tall grass around you. Your footsteps, be they ever so light, strike the
ear of the watchful Kildeer, who, with a velocity scarcely surpassed by
that of any other bird, comes up, and is now passing and repassing swiftly
around you. His clear notes indicate his alarm, and seem to demand why
<i>you</i> are there. To see him is now impossible, for a cloud has shrouded
the moon; but on your left and right, before and behind, his continued
vociferations intimate how glad he would be to see you depart from his
beloved hunting-grounds. Nay, be not surprised if he should follow you
until his eyes, meeting the glaring light of a woodsman traveller, he will
wheel off and bid you adieu.
</p>

<p>
The Kildeer’s large eyes seem to be given it to enable it to feed by
night as well as by day. At any time after the breeding season, this
species moves in loose flocks, seldom exceeding ten or fifteen individuals,
which disperse over the space of an acre or two of ground. Yet some one
of them always acts as a sentinel, for standing erect to the full stretch of
its legs, it carefully watches all the moving objects around, as far as its
eye can reach. Cows, horses, or sheep are none of its enemies, and among
them it will seek for food; but let a man, or a dog, or any other animal
bent on destruction, shew himself, and that instant the bird runs swiftly
with a querulous note, and should any of these his enemies evince the
least disposition to molest it, its beautiful wings and tail are spread, and
away it goes, cheerily calling to its companions to follow.
</p>

<p>
The Kildeer is by most people called a “noisy bird and restless.”
Now to me it is any thing but this, unless indeed when it is disturbed by
the approach or appearance of its enemies, more particularly man, of
whom indeed few wild birds are fond. Watch them from under some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
cover that completely conceals you, and you will see them peaceably and
silently follow their avocations for hours. In this respect the Kildeer
resembles the Lapwing of Europe, which is also called a restless and
noisy bird, because men and dogs are ever in pursuit of the poor thing,
which after all its vigilance often falls a prey to the sportsman, who condemns
it merely because it endeavours to draw him from its nest or young.
During winter, when undisturbed, the Kildeer is in fact an unusually silent
bird. In Louisiana, where it breeds and resides at all seasons, it has obtained
the name of “Piallard,” so strongly rooted are old prejudices.
</p>

<p>
The Kildeer, or more properly “Kildee,” so named on account of its
note, which may be imitated by the syllables <i>kildee, kildee, dee, dee, dee</i>,
appear in much greater numbers in the interior than along the coast.
Few are seen in the State of Maine; none, I believe, in Nova Scotia, any
more than in Newfoundland or Labrador. Inland, however, these birds
remove to a great distance north. Unless during winter, in fact, this
species is not wont to approach the shores of the sea, but prefers the
newly ploughed fields, the banks of clear rivers, or the elevated worn-out
grounds of the interior. Few winter to the east of Boston, while during
the cold season they abound in the Southern States, although thousands
spend the most rigorous months in the Western Country. In the
Floridas, Georgia, and South Carolina, you find them dispersed through
the sugar, cotton and rice fields; and now they are so gentle and so silent,
that you can hardly conceive why they should be called noisy birds.
Around the pools, upon the marshes, and along the oyster-beds at low
tides, as well as on the extensive mud-flats, you will then meet with them
diligently searching for food, and not neglecting to watch you with distrust.
Even in the corn-fields and in company with Doves and Grakles,
or by the side of some strolling Partridge, you may now and then spy
the Kildeer. At this period I have sometimes got so near to it that I
could clearly see the pale red margin of its beautiful eye. The bird
would perhaps run a few steps, when suddenly checking its course, it would
stand still, erect and rigid. Should I level my gun in jest, he would that
instant fly off low over the ground, removing to the distance of a hundred
yards, alight running as it were, advance twenty or thirty steps more,
and then stand still. I would now again approach it as before. Never
try it the third time, Reader, the Kildeer will denounce you as an enemy.
It will stretch its wings, fly across a river or field, and leave you to amuse
yourself as you may. Many a time have I been thus treated.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Kildeer is strong and rapid, and is at times protracted
to a great distance. It skims quite low over the ground, or plays
at a great height in the air, particularly during the love season, when
you may see these birds performing all sorts of evolutions on wing. On
the ground their speed is such that it has become proverbial, and to “run
like a Kildee,” is to move with the utmost possible agility. Their ordinary
posture when standing, might be called stiff, were they not so beautiful
in form and colouring. When pursued over a large space, they
are able to lead you from one spot to another more than twenty times in
the course of an hour; and the more you follow them, the more shy do
they become, until wearied and hungry, as the fox said of the grapes,
you will probably begin to think them poor and insipid after all.
</p>

<p>
Now you see the Kildee wading in the water, and observe how it
splashes it about. Down it lays itself, and with fluttering wings, seems
to enjoy the sight of the drops trickling over its silky back. Now dripping
and almost soaked to the skin, it retires to the warm earth, to dry
its plumage and clear it of insects.
</p>

<p>
This species breeds in Louisiana about the beginning of April; in the
Middle States a full month later, as well as in the Western Country and
farther north. Not one, however, has ever been found breeding in the
low lands of South Carolina, although these birds remain there until the
beginning of May. The nests are various, some being merely a hollow
scooped in the bare ground, while at other times the Kildee searches for
a place on the edge of a pond, forms a hollow, and constructs a nest of
grass, at the foot of a thick bunch of plants. Now and then small
pebbles and fragments of shells are raised in the form of a rim around
the eggs, on which the sitting bird is seen as if elevated two or three
inches. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> saw nests of this kind; so have I; and the circumstance
appeared as strange to me as that of the birds not breeding in the low
lands of the Carolinas. The eggs are almost always four, pyriform, well
pointed at the small end, an inch and five-eighths in length, an inch and
one eighth in diameter at the broadest part, and of a deep cream colour,
pretty generally marked all over with small irregular blotches of purplish-brown
and black. The young, as soon as hatched, run about. At this
period, or during incubation, the parents, who sit alternately on the eggs,
never leaving them to the heat of the sun, are extremely clamorous at
sight of an enemy. The female droops her wings, emits her plaintive
notes, and endeavours by every means she can devise to draw you from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
the nest or young. The male dashes over you in the air, in the manner
of the European Lapwing, and vociferates all the remonstrances of
an angry parent whose family is endangered. If you cannot find pity
for the poor birds at such a time, you may take up their eggs and see their
distress; but if you be at all so tender-hearted as I would wish you to
be, it will be quite unnecessary for me to recommend mercy!
</p>

<p>
Few Plovers with which I am acquainted, acquire their full plumage
sooner than this species. Before December you can observe no difference
between the young birds and their parents; nay by this time, like most
other species, the former are as fully able to fly as at any other period.
</p>

<p>
While I was residing in Pennsylvania, the son of my tenant the miller
was in the habit of catching newly-hatched birds of every sort, to
bait his fish-hooks. I had rather peremptorily remonstrated against this
barbarous practice, although, I believe, without effect. One morning I
met him returning from the shores of the Perkioming Creek, with his hat
full of young Kildees. He endeavoured to avoid me, but I made directly
up to him, peeped into his hat and saw the birds. On this I begged
of him to go back and restore the poor things to their parents, which he
reluctantly did. Never had I felt more happy than I did when I saw
the young Plovers run off and hide under cover of the stones.
</p>

<p>
The Kildee seems to be remarkably attached to certain localities at
particular periods. Whilst at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s in East Florida, I
accidentally wounded one near a barn on the plantation of my accomplished
host. Yet it returned to the same spot for the ten days that I remained
there, although it always flew off when I approached it.
</p>

<p>
The food of this species consists of earth-worms, grass-hoppers,
crickets, and coleopterous insects, as well as small crustacea, whether of
salt or fresh water, and snails. Now and then they may be seen thrusting
their bills into the mud about oysters, in search of some other food.
During autumn, they run about the old fields and catch an insect which
the Blue Bird has been watching with anxious care from the top of a
withering mullein stalk. They run briskly after the ploughman, to pick
up the worms that have been turned out of their burrows. Now standing
on the grassy meadow, after a shower, you see them patting the moist
ground, to force out its inhabitants. During winter, you meet with them
on elevated ground, or along the margins of the rivers; but wherever
you observe one about to pick up its food, you clearly see its body moving
in a see-saw manner on the joints of the legs, until the former being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
so placed that the bill can reach the ground, the object is seized, and the
usual horizontal position is resumed.
</p>

<p>
The flesh of the Kildee is generally indifferent, unless in early autumn,
when the young birds of that season are fat, juicy and tender. At all
seasons of the year, the Kildee is however shot by inexperienced sportsmen,
and many of these birds are offered for sale in our markets. Little
difference is observed at any period in the plumage of the adult birds.

<h2><a id="WP"></a>
THE WHITE PERCH AND ITS FAVORITE
BAIT.
</h2>

<p>
No sooner have the overflowing waters of early spring subsided within
their banks, and the temperature become pleasant, than the trees of our
woods are seen to unfold their buds and blossoms, and the White Perch,
which during the winter has lived in the ocean, rushes up our streams,
to seek the well-known haunts in which it last year deposited its spawn.
With unabating vigour it ascends the turbulent current of the Mississippi,
of which, however, the waters are too muddy to suit its habits; and
glad no doubt is it to enter one of the numberless tributaries whose limpid
waters are poured into the mighty river. Of these subsidiary waters
the Ohio is one in whose pure stream the White Perch seems to delight;
and towards its head springs the fish advances in numerous shoals, following
the banks with easy progress. Over many a pebbly or gravelly bar
does it seek its food. Here the crawling mussel it crunches and devours;
there, with the speed of an arrow, it darts upon the minnow; again, at
the edge of a shelving rock, or by the side of a stone, it secures a crayfish.
No impure food will “the Growler” touch; therefore, reader, never
make use of such to allure it, otherwise not only will your time be lost,
but you will not enjoy the gratification of tasting this delicious fish.
Should you have no experience in fishing for perch, I would recommend
to you to watch the men you see on that shore, for they are excellent
anglers.
</p>

<p>
Smooth are the waters, clear is the sky, and gently does the stream
move,—perhaps its velocity does not exceed a mile in the hour. Silence
reigns around you. See, each fisher has a basket or calabash, containing
many a live cray; and each line, as thick as a crow quill, measures scarce
a furlong. At one end two perch hooks are so fastened that they cannot
interfere with each other. A few inches below the reaching point of the
farthest hook, the sinker, perhaps a quarter of a pound in weight, having
a hole bored through its length, is passed upon the line, and there secured
by a stout knot at its lower extremity. The other end of the line is fastened
ashore. The tackle, you observe, is carefully coiled on the sand at
the fisher’s feet. Now on each hook he fixes a cray-fish, piercing the shell
beneath the tail, and forcing the keen weapon to reach the very head of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' href='#Page_198'>198</a></span>
the suffering creature, while all its legs are left at liberty to move. Now,
each man, holding his line a yard or so from the hooks, whirls it several
times overhead, and sends it off to its full length directly across the
stream. No sooner has it reached the gravelly bed, than gently urged
by the current, it rolls over and over, until it is nearly in the line of the
water. Before this, however, I see that several of the men have had a
bite, and that by a short jerk they have hooked the fish. Hand over
hand they haul in their lines. Poor perch, it is useless labour for thee to
flounce and splash in that manner, for no pity will be shewn thee, and
thou shalt be dashed on the sand, and left there to quiver in the agonies
of death. The lines are within a few yards of being in. I see the fish
gasping on its side. Ah! there are two on this line, both good; on most
of the others there is one; but I see some of the lines have been robbed
by some cunning inhabitant of the water. What beautiful fishes these
perches are! so silvery beneath, so deeply coloured above! What a fine
eye too! But, friend, I cannot endure their gaspings. Pray put them
on this short line, and place them in the water beside you, until you prepare
to go home. In a few hours each fisher has obtained as many as he
wishes. He rolls up his line, fastens five or six perches on each side of
his saddle, mounts his horse, and merrily wends his way.
</p>

<p>
In this manner the White Perch is caught along the sandy banks of
the Ohio, from its mouth to its source. In many parts above Louisville
some fishers prefer using the trot-line, which, however, ought to be placed
upon, or very little above, the bottom of the stream. When this kind of
line is employed, its hooks are more frequently baited with mussels than
with cray-fish, the latter being perhaps not so easily procured there as farther
down the stream. Great numbers of perches are also caught in seines,
especially during a transient rise of the water. Few persons fish for them
with the pole, as they generally prefer following the edges of the sandbars
next to deep water. Like all others of its tribe, the White Perch
is fond of depositing its spawn on gravelly or sandy beds, but rarely at a
depth of less than four or five feet. These beds are round, and have an
elevated margin formed of the sand removed from their centre, which is
scooped out for two or three inches. The fish, although it generally remains
for some days over its treasure, is by no means so careful of it as
the little sunny, but starts off at the least appearance of danger. I have
more than once taken considerable pleasure in floating over their beds,
when the water was sufficiently clear to admit of my seeing both the fish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' href='#Page_199'>199</a></span>
and its place of deposit; but I observed that if the sun was shining, the
very sight of the boat’s shadow drove the perches away. I am of opinion
that most of them return to the sea about the beginning of November;
but of this I am not certain.
</p>

<p>
The usual length of this fish, which on the Ohio is called the White
Perch, and in the State of New York the Growler, is from fifteen to twenty
inches. I have, however, seen some considerably larger. The weight
varies from a pound and a half to four, and even six pounds. For the
first six weeks of their arrival in fresh water streams they are in season;
the flesh is then white and firm, and affords excellent eating; but during
the heats of summer, they become poor, and are seldom very good. Now
and then, in the latter days of September, I have eaten some that tasted
as well as in spring. One of the most remarkable habits of this fish is
that from which it has received the name of Growler. When poised in
the water, close to the bottom of a boat, it emits a rough croaking noise,
somewhat resembling a groan. Whenever this sound is heard under a
boat, if the least disturbance is made by knocking on the gunwale or bottom,
it at once ceases; but is renewed when every thing is quiet. It is
seldom heard, however, unless in fine calm weather.
</p>

<p>
The White Perch bites at the hook with considerable care, and very
frequently takes off the bait without being caught. Indeed, it requires a
good deal of dexterity to hook it, for if this is not done the first time it
touches the bait, you rarely succeed afterwards; and I have seen young
hands at the game, who, in the course of a morning, seldom caught more
than one or two, although they lost perhaps twenty crays. But, now that
I have afforded you some information respecting the habits of the White
Perch, allow me to say a few words on the subject of its favourite bait.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The Cray is certainly not a fish, although usually so styled; but as
every one is acquainted with its form and nature, I shall not inflict on
you any disquisition regarding it. It is a handsome crustaceous animal
certainly, and its whole tribe I consider as dainties of the first order. To
me “<i>Ecrevisses</i>,” whether of fresh or of salt water, stripped of their coats,
and blended into a soup or a “gombo,” have always been most welcome.
Boiled or roasted too, they are excellent in my estimation, and mayhap in
yours. The Crayfish, of which I here more particularly speak—for I
shall not deprive them of their caudal appendage, lest, like a basha without
his tail, they might seem of less consequence—are found most abundantly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
swimming, crawling at the bottom or on shore, or working at their
muddy burrows, in all the southern parts of the Union. If I mistake
not, we have two species at least, one more an inhabitant of rocky streamlets
than the other, and that one by far the best, though the other is good
too. Both species swim by means of rapid strokes of the tail, which propel
them backwards to a considerable distance at each repetition. All
that I regret concerning these animals is, that they are absolutely little
aquatic vultures—or, if you please, crustacea with vulturine habits—for
they feed on every thing impure that comes in their way, when they
cannot obtain fresh aliment. However this may be, the Crays somehow
fall in with this sort of food, and any person may catch as many as he may
wish, by fastening a piece of flesh to a line, allowing it to remain under
water for a while, and drawing it up with care, when, with the aid of a
hand-net, he may bring it ashore with <i>a few</i>! But although this is a
good method of procuring Cray-fish, it answers only for those that live
in running waters. The form of these is delicate, their colour a light
olive, and their motions in the water are very lively. The others are
larger, of a dark greenish-brown, less active in the water than on land,
although they are most truly amphibious. The first conceal themselves
beneath shelving rocks, stones, or water-plants; the others form a deep
burrow in the damp earth, depositing the materials drawn up, as a man
would do in digging a well. The manner in which they dispose of the
mud you may see by glancing at the plate of the White Ibis, in my
third volume of Illustrations, where also you will find a tolerable portrait
of one of these creatures.
</p>

<p>
According to the nature of the ground, the burrows of this Crayfish
are more or less deep. Indeed, this also depends partly on the increasing
dryness of the soil, when, influenced by the heat of summer, as well as
on the texture of the substratum. Thus, in some places, where the Cray
can reach the water after working a few inches, it rests contented during
the day, but crawls out for food at night. Should it, however, be left
dry, it renews its labour; and thus while one burrow may be only five or
six inches deep, another may be two or three feet, and a third even more.
They are easily procured when thus lodged in shallow holes; but when
the burrow is deep, a thread is used, with a small piece of flesh fastened
to it. The Cray eagerly seizes the bait, and is gently drawn up, and
thrown to a distance, when he becomes an easy prey. You have read of
the method used by the White Ibis in procuring Crays; and I leave you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
to judge whether the bird or the man is the best fisher. This species is
most abundant round the borders of the stagnant lakes, bayous, or ponds
of the Southern Districts; and I have seen them caught even in the
streets of the suburbs of New Orleans, after a heavy shower. They become
a great pest by perforating embankments of all sorts, and many are
the maledictions that are uttered against them both by millers and planters,
nay even by the overseers of the levees along the banks of the Mississippi.
But they are curious creatures, formed no doubt for useful purposes,
and as such they are worthy of your notice.

</p>

<p>
The variegated foliage of the woods indicates that the latter days of
October have arrived; gloomy clouds spread over the heavens; the fierce
blasts of the north, as if glad to escape from the dreary regions of their
nativity, sport in dreadful revelry among the forests and glades. Showers
of sleet and snow descend at intervals, and the careful husbandman gathers
his flocks, to drive them to a place of shelter. The traveller gladly
accepts the welcome of the forester, and as he seats himself by the blazing
fire, looks with pleasure on the spinning wheels of the industrious inmates.
The lumberer prepares to set out on his long voyage, the trapper
seeks the retreats of the industrious beaver, and the red Indian is making
arrangements for his winter hunts. The Ducks and Geese have already
reached the waters of the western ponds; here a Swan or two is seen
following in their train, and as the observer of nature stands watching
the appearances and events of this season of change, he hears from on
high the notes of the swiftly travelling but unseen Whooping Crane.
Suddenly the turbid atmosphere clears, and now he can perceive the
passing birds. Gradually they descend, dress their extended lines, and
prepare to alight on the earth. With necks outstretched, and long bony
legs extended behind, they proceed supported by wings white as the snow
but tipped with jet, until arriving over the great savannah they wheel
their circling flight, and slowly approach the ground, on which with half-closed
wings, and outstretched feet they alight, running along for a few
steps to break the force of their descent.
</p>

<p>
Reader, see the majestic bird shake its feathers, and again arrange
them in order. Proud of its beautiful form, and prouder still of its
power of flight, it stalks over the withering grasses with all the majesty
of a gallant chief. With long and measured steps be moves along, his
head erect, his eye glistening with delight. His great journey is accomplished,
and being well acquainted with a country which has often been
visited by him, he at once commences his winter avocations.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Whooping Crane reaches the Western Country about the middle
of October, or the beginning of November, in flocks of twenty or
thirty individuals, sometimes of twice or thrice that number, the young
by themselves, but closely followed by their parents. They spread from
Illinois over Kentucky, and all the intermediate States, until they reach
the Carolinas on the southern coast, the Floridas, Louisiana, and the
countries bordering on Mexico, in all of which they spend the winter,
seldom returning northward until about the middle of April, or towards
the beginning of May. They are seen on the edges of large ponds supplied
with rank herbage, on fields or savannahs, now in swampy woods,
and again on extensive marshes. The interior of the country, and the
neighbourhood of the sea shores, suit them equally well, so long as the
temperature is sufficiently high. In the Middle States, it is very seldom
indeed that they are seen; and to the eastward of these countries they are
unknown; for all their migrations are performed far inland, and thus
they leave and return to the northern retreats where, it is said, they breed
and spend the summer. While migrating they appear to travel both by
night and by day, and I have frequently heard them at the former, and
seen them at the latter time, as they were proceeding toward their destination.
Whether the weather be calm or tempestuous, it makes no difference
to them, their power of flight being such as to render them regardless
of the winds. Nay I have observed them urging their way during
very heavy gales, shifting from high to low in the air with remarkable
dexterity. The members of a flock sometimes arrange themselves in
the form of an acute-angled triangle; sometimes they move in a long
line; again they mingle together without order, or form an extended
front; but in whatever manner they advance, each bird sounds his loud
note in succession, and on all occasions of alarm these birds manifest the
same habit. While with us they are also always met with in flocks.
But now, Reader, allow me to refer to my journals, whence I shall extract
some circumstances relative to this majestic bird, which I hope you
will find not uninteresting.
</p>

<p>
<i>Louisville, State of Kentucky, March 1810.</i>—I had the gratification
of taking <span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span> to some ponds within a few miles of
town, and of shewing him many birds of this species, of which he had
not previously seen any other than stuffed specimens. I told him that
the white birds were the adults, and that the grey ones were the young.
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, in his article on the Whooping Crane, has alluded to this, but,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
as on other occasions, has not informed his readers whence the information
came.
</p>

<p>
<i>Henderson, November 1810.</i>—The Sand Hill Crane arrived at the
Long Pond on the 28th of last month. I saw two flocks of young ones
there, and one of adults on the Slim Pond. Both old and young immediately
set to digging through the mud, the rains having scarcely begun to
cover those places with water, for during summer they become almost dry.
The birds work very assiduously with their bills, and succeed in uncovering
the large roots of the great water-lily, which often run to a depth of
two or three feet. Several cranes are seen in the same hole, tugging at
roots and other substances, until they reach the object of their desire,
which they greedily devour. While thus engaged, they are easily approached;
for if their heads are bent down they cannot see you, and until
they raise themselves again, to take notice of what may be going on
around the place, you may advance so as to get within shot. While I
watched them at this work, they were perfectly silent; and as I lay concealed
behind a large cypress tree, within thirty paces of a flock, thus
buried, as it were, in the great holes they had formed, so as to put me in
mind of a parcel of hogs or bears at their wallowing spots, I could plainly
see the colour of their eyes, which is brown in the young, and yellow in
the adult. After observing them as long as I wished, I whistled, on which
they all at once raised their heads to see what the matter might be. I
had so fair an opportunity that I could not resist the temptation, especially
as several of the birds had their necks so close together that I felt
confident I must kill more than one of them. Accordingly, just as their
last croaking notes were heard, and I saw them preparing to set to work
again, I fired. Only two flew up, to my surprise. They came down the
pond towards me, and my next shot brought them to the ground. On
walking to the hole, I found that I had disabled seven in all. Those
which were in different holes farther off, all flew away, uttering loud cries,
and did not return that afternoon. In the course of a week these birds
turned up the earth, and dug holes all over the dry parts of the ponds.
As soon as heavy rains fill the pools, the Cranes abandon them, and resort
to other places.
</p>

<p>
<i>Natchez, November 1821.</i>—The Sand-hill Cranes now resort to the
fields, in which corn, pease, and sweet potatoes have been planted, as well
as to the cotton plantations. They feed on the grains and pease, dig up
the potatoes, which they devour with remarkable greediness; and in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
wet fields seize on water insects, toads and frogs, but never, I believe,
on fishes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Bayou Sara, April 12. 1822.</i>—The Sand-hill Cranes have left all the
fields, and removed to the swamps and inner lakes. I saw some catching
young bull-frogs, water-lizards, and water-snakes, as well as very small
alligators. One struck at a young snapping turtle, which, however, escaped.
The Wood Ibises and these birds do not agree together; the latter
chase the former up to their bellies in the water.
</p>

<p>
<i>April 16.</i>—I saw nine beautiful adult birds apparently in perfect
plumage. They were round a fallen log, about twenty yards from the
water, all very busily occupied in killing a band of young alligators, which
had probably endeavoured to save themselves from the attacks of the
Cranes by crawling beneath the sides of the log. I shot at them without
much effect, for, although I believe I wounded two of them, they all flew
off. On going up to the log, I found several young alligators, measuring
from seven to eight inches in length, apparently dead, with their heads
sadly bruised as if by a powerful blow. This led me to think that they
kill a number of animals before they feed upon them, as the Wood Ibis
is wont to do. This afternoon I saw four of these young Cranes tearing
up the ground in search of cray-fish. One caught a butterfly as it was
fluttering near, and instantly swallowed it.
</p>

<p>
This species feeds only during the day. Besides the objects which I
have already mentioned, it now and then swallows a mole or a meadow-mouse,
and not unfrequently, I think, snakes of considerable length. I
opened one that had a garter-snake, more than fifteen inches long, in its
stomach.
</p>

<p>
The wariness of this species is so remarkable, that it takes all the cunning
and care of an Indian hunter to approach it at times, especially in
the case of an old bird. The acuteness of their sight and hearing is quite
wonderful. If they perceive a man approaching, even at the distance of
a quarter of a mile, they are sure to take to wing. Should you accidentally
tread on a stick and break it, or suddenly cock your gun, all the
birds in the flock raise their heads and emit a cry. Shut the gate of a
field after you, and from that moment they all watch your motions. To
attempt to crawl towards them, even among long grass, after such an intimation,
would be useless; and unless you lie in wait for them, and be
careful to maintain a perfect silence, or may have the cover of some large
trees, heaps of brushwood, or fallen logs, you may as well stay at home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
They generally see you long before you perceive them, and so long as
they are aware that you have not observed them, they remain silent; but
the moment that, by some inadvertency, you disclose to them your sense
of their presence, some of them sound an alarm. For my part, Reader,
I would as soon undertake to catch a deer by fair running, as to shoot a
Sand-hill Crane that had observed me. Sometimes, indeed, towards the
approach of spring, when they are ready to depart for their breeding
grounds, the voice of one will startle and urge to flight all within a mile
of the spot. When this happens, all the birds around join into a great
flock, gradually rise in a spiral manner, ascend to a vast height, and sail
off in a straight course.
</p>

<p>
When wounded, these birds cannot be approached without caution, as
their powerful bill is capable of inflicting a severe wound. Knowing this
as I do, I would counsel any sportsman not to leave his gun behind,
while pursuing a wounded Crane. One afternoon in winter, as I was
descending the Mississippi, on my way to Natchez, I saw several Cranes
standing on a large sand-bar. The sight of these beautiful birds excited
in me a desire to procure some of them. Accordingly, taking a rifle and
some ammunition, I left the flat-bottomed boat in a canoe, and told the
men to watch for me, as the current was rapid at that place, the river
being there narrowed by the sand-bar. I soon paddled myself to the
shore, and having observed, that, by good management, I might approach
the Cranes under cover of a huge stranded tree, I landed opposite to it,
drew up my canoe, and laying myself flat on the sand, crawled the best
way I could, pushing my gun before me. On reaching the log, I cautiously
raised my head opposite to a large branch, and saw the birds at a
distance somewhat short of a hundred yards. I took, as I thought, an
excellent aim, although my anxiety to shew the boatmen how good a
marksman I was rendered it less sure than it might otherwise have been.
I fired, when all the birds instantly flew off greatly alarmed, excepting
one which leaped into the air, but immediately came down again, and
walked leisurely away with a drooping pinion. As I rose on my feet, it
saw me, I believe, for the first time, cried out lustily, and ran off with
the speed of an ostrich. I left my rifle unloaded, and in great haste pursued
the wounded bird, which doubtless would have escaped had it not
made towards a pile of drift wood, where I overtook it. As I approached
it, panting and almost exhausted, it immediately raised itself to the full
stretch of its body, legs, and neck, ruffled its feathers, shook them, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
advanced towards me with open bill, and eyes glancing with anger. I
cannot tell you whether it was from feeling almost exhausted with the
fatigue of the chase; but, however it was, I felt unwilling to encounter
my antagonist, and keeping my eye on him, moved backwards. The farther
I removed, the more he advanced, until at length I fairly turned my
back to him, and took to my heels, retreating with fully more speed than
I had pursued. He followed, and I was glad to reach the river, into
which I plunged up to the neck, calling out to my boatmen, who came
up as fast as they could. The Crane stood looking angrily on me all the
while, immersed up to his belly in the water, and only a few yards distant,
now and then making thrusts at me with his bill. There he stood
until the people came up; and highly delighted they were with my situation.
However, the battle was soon over, for, on landing, some of them
struck the winged warrior on the neck with an oar, and we carried him
on board.
</p>

<p>
While in the Floridas, I saw only a few of these birds alive, but many
which had been shot by the Spaniards and Indians, for the sake of their
flesh and beautiful feathers, of which latter they make fans and fly-brushes.
None of these birds remain there during summer; and <span class="smcap">William
Bartram</span>, when speaking of this species, must have mistaken the
Wood Ibis for it.
</p>

<p>
The young are considerably more numerous than the old white birds;
and this circumstance has probably led to the belief among naturalists
that the former constitute a distinct species, to which the name of Canada
Crane, <i>Grus canadensis</i>, has been given. This, however, I hope, I shall
be able to clear up to your satisfaction. In the mean time, I shall continue
my remarks.

According to circumstances, this species roosts either on the ground
or on high trees. In the latter case, they leave their feeding-ground
about an hour before sun-set, and going off in silence, proceed towards
the interior of high land forests, where they alight on the largest branches
of lofty trees, six or seven settling on the same branch. For half an
hour or so, they usually dress their plumage, standing erect: but afterwards
they crouch in the manner of Wild Turkeys. In this situation
they are sometimes shot by moonlight. Those which resort to plantations,
situated in the vicinity of large marshes, covered with tall grasses,
cat’s tails, and other plants, spend the night on some hillock, standing on
one leg, the other being drawn under the body, whilst the head is thrust
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
beneath the broad feathers of the shoulder. In returning towards the
feeding grounds, they all emit their usual note, but in a very low undertone,
leaving their roost at an earlier or later hour, according to the state
of the weather. When it is cold and clear, they start very early; but
when warm and rainy, not until late in the morning. Their motions toward
night are determined by the same circumstances. They rise easily
from the ground after running a few steps, fly low for thirty or forty
yards, then rise in circles, crossing each other in their windings, like Vultures,
Ibises, and some other birds. If startled or shot at, they utter
loud and piercing cries. These cries, which I cannot compare to the
sounds of any instrument known to me, I have heard at the distance of
three miles, at the approach of spring, when the males were paying their
addresses to the females, or fighting among themselves. They may be in
some degree represented by the syllables <i>kewrr</i>, <i>kewrr</i>, <i>kewrooh</i>; and
strange and uncouth as they are, they have always sounded delightful in
my ear.
</p>

<p>
In December 1833, I sent my son to Spring Island, on the coast of
Georgia, to which these birds are in the habit of resorting every winter.
Mr <span class="smcap">Hammond</span>, the proprietor of this island, treated him with all the hospitality
for which the southern planters are celebrated. The Cranes,
which were plentiful, resorted to the sweet potato fields, digging up their
produce as expertly as a troop of negroes. They walked carefully over
the little heaps, probed them in various parts in the manner of Woodcocks
or Snipes, and whenever they hit upon a potato, removed the soil,
took out the root, and devoured it in rather small pieces. In this manner
they would search over the whole field, which was two miles in length, and
rather more than a quarter of a mile in breadth, gleaning all the potatoes
that had escaped the gatherers. They were so shy, however, that notwithstanding
all the endeavours of my son, who is a good hand at getting
in upon game, as well as a good shot, he only killed a young one, which
was evidently of that year’s brood, it being yet almost reddish-brown, the
long feathers of the rump just beginning to shew, and the head yet covered
with hairlike feathers to the mandible, and merely shewing between
them the wrinkled skin so conspicuous in the old birds. The specimen
procured on Spring Island was carefully examined and described, and
the skin is now in the British Museum in London. Its flesh was tender
and juicy, of a colour resembling that of young venison, and afforded excellent
eating. This I have always found to be the case with young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
birds of this species, so long as they are in their brown livery, and even
when they have begun to be patched with white; but in old birds the
flesh becomes very dark, tough and unfit for the table, although the
Seminole Indians shoot them on all occasions for food.
</p>

<p>
In captivity the Whooping Crane becomes extremely gentle, and feeds
freely on grain and other vegetable substances. A Mr <span class="smcap">Magwood</span>, residing
near Charleston, in South Carolina, kept one for some time feeding
it on maize. It accidentally wounded one of its feet on the shell of
an oyster, and, although the greatest care was taken of it, died after lingering
some weeks. Having myself kept one alive, I will give you an account
of its habits.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly full-grown when I obtained it, and its plumage was
changing from greyish-brown to white. Its figure you will see in the
plate to which this article refers. I received it as a present from Captain
<span class="smcap">Clack</span> of the United States Navy, commander of the Erie sloop of war.
It had been wounded in the wing, on the coast of Florida, but the fractured
limb had been amputated and soon healed. During a voyage of
three months, it became very gentle, and was a great favourite with the
sailors. I placed it in a yard, in company with a beautiful Snow Goose.
This was at Boston. It was so gentle as to suffer me to caress it with
the hand, and was extremely fond of searching for worms and grubs
about the wood-pile, probing every hole it saw with as much care and
dexterity as an Ivory-billed Woodpecker. It also watched with all the
patience of a cat the motions of some mice which had burrows near the
same spot, killed them with a single blow, and swallowed them entire, one
after another, until they were extirpated. I fed it on corn and garbage
from the kitchen, to which were added bits of bread and cheese, as well
as some apples. It would pick up the straws intended to keep its feet
from being soiled, and arrange them round its body, as if intent on forming
a nest. For hours at a time, it would stand resting on one foot in a very
graceful posture; but what appeared to me very curious was, that it had
a favourite leg for this purpose; and in fact none of my family ever found
it standing on the other, although it is probable that this happened in
consequence of the mutilation of the wing, the leg employed being that
of the injured side. The stump of its amputated wing appeared to be
a constant source of trouble, particularly at the approach of the winter:
it would dress the feathers about it, and cover it with so much care
that I really felt for the poor fellow. When the weather became intensely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
cold, it regularly retired at the approach of night under a covered passage,
where it spent the hours of darkness; but it always repaired to this
place with marked reluctance, and never until all was quiet and nearly dark,
and it came out, even when the snow lay deep on the ground, at the first appearance
of day. Now and then it would take a run, extend its only wing,
and, uttering a loud cry, leap several times in the air, as if anxious to return
to its haunts. At other times it would look upwards, cry aloud as
if calling to some acquaintance passing high in the air, and again use its
ordinary note whenever its companion the Snow Goose sent forth her own
signals. It seldom swallowed its food without first carrying it to the
water, and dipping it several times, and now and then it would walk
many yards for that express purpose. Although the winter was severe,
the thermometer some mornings standing as low as 10°, the bird fattened
and looked extremely well. So strong was the natural suspicion of this
bird, that I frequently saw it approach some cabbage leaves with measured
steps, look at each sideways before it would touch one of them,
and after all, if it by accident tossed the leaf into the air when attempting
to break it to pieces, it would run off as if some dreaded enemy were
at hand.
</p>

<p>
The trachea of this bird, of which you will find a notice at <a href="#Page_213">p. 213</a>,
confirms my opinion that the Canada Crane and the Whooping Crane are
merely the same species in different states of plumage, or in other words,
at different ages; and, in truth, the differences are not greater than those
exhibited by many other birds, both aquatic and terrestrial. In illustration
of this subject I might adduce Ibises, Herons, Divers, and Grebes;
but this is quite unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
In reading the accounts given of the Canada Crane of authors, I find
no description of its manner of breeding. In the Fauna Boreali-Americana
of Mr <span class="smcap">Swainson</span> and Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, the eggs of both are described,
and in <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>’s Manual those of the Whooping Crane also; but
in these works the account given of the birds and of their eggs is such,
that one might even, from comparing the descriptions, suppose them to be
of the same species. I have never had the satisfaction of finding any of
the breeding-places of the Whooping Crane; but I well know that many
birds breed long before they have attained their full plumage. The supposed
new species of Heron described under the name of <i>Ardea Pealii</i>,
by my excellent friend Prince <span class="smcap">Charles Bonaparte</span>, breeds as the White-headed
Eagle sometimes does, the immature bird in a snow-white dress,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
the adult in purple and greyish-blue plumage. The young of <i>Ardea
cœrulea</i> were for some time considered to form a distinct species, they
being white also, then blue and white, and finally dark blue. But the
most remarkable instance of change of plumage in the Waders is exhibited
in the Scarlet Ibis. My humble opinion is, that unless in cases
where birds are at first of one colour, and that colour remains ever after,
little dependence can be placed on the tints of the plumage as a specific
character.
</p>

<p>
On looking over my notes, I find that I have omitted to inform you
that the extraordinary strength of the thighs, legs, and feet of the
Whooping Crane, tends greatly to make it more terrestrial than the
Herons; and that the great size of their nostrils, which so much resemble
those of the Vultures, is well adapted to keep the inner parts of the
organ from the damp earth and other matters with which they are so often
in contact, while searching in the ground or mud for roots and other
vegetable substances, on which the bird principally feeds. I am convinced
also, that this species does not attain its full size or perfect plumage
until it is four or five years old. The beauty of the plumage may
be improved in brilliancy during the breeding-season by a greater brightness
in the colour of the bill, as in the Booby Gannet and White Ibis, as
well as in the redness of the fleshy parts of the head.
</p>

<p>
The measurements of the adult bird of my plate, drawn at New Orleans,
in the month of April, were as follows:—Length from tip of bill
to end of claws, 5 feet 5 inches; to end of tail, 4 feet 6 inches; the drooping
feathers 1 foot beyond; alar extent 7 feet 8 inches; length of wing
22 inches; naked part of thigh 5 inches; tarsus

<p>
The measurements of the specimen kept at Boston:—Length from
tip of bill to end of tail, 3 feet 9 inches; to end of claws, 4 feet 6 inches;
tarsus 8 inches; naked part of thigh
<span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>. The elongated inner secondaries

<span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inches, the claws being 7 inches beyond the tail, so that the length from
the tip of the bill to the end of the tail was 3 feet
<span class="mixfract">9&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches; alar extent

<p>
In the Museum of the University of Edinburgh, there is a specimen
of still smaller size.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, in a note addressed to me, says, “I saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
a pair of tame birds of this species, which, as they advanced in age,
changed their colours from grey to white.”

<h2>
THE PINTAIL DUCK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anus acuta</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
The first observation that I made on arriving at Labrador, was that
no species of Ducks, excepting those which were entirely or chiefly oceanic,
seemed to resort to that coast, and I left the country with the same
impression. We saw no Mallards, Teals, Widgeons, or Wood Ducks
there; nor any species of Merganser, excepting the Red-breasted, which is
a marine bird. The Pintail Duck, then, was not seen in the parts of that
country which I visited; nor was it known in Newfoundland, on the
Magdeleine Islands, or in the British province of Nova Scotia, at least
along its Atlantic boundaries. In Kentucky and the whole of the Western
Country, where it is extremely abundant in early autumn, during
winter, and up to a very advanced period in spring, you meet with it
wherever its usual food is found. It follows the waters of the Mississippi
to New Orleans, is seen westward in the prairies of Oppelousas, and extends
to the eastward as far as Massachusetts, beyond which, like the
Mallard, it is very seldom seen. Indeed, this species is at all times rare
on the sea coast of America, and must therefore be considered as an inland
bird.
</p>

<p>
The Pintail, which, in the United States, is better known by the name
of Sprigtail, arrives on the western waters early in October, sometimes
even about the middle of September, the period of its arrival depending
on the state of the weather, or the appearance of other species, with which
it keeps company. Their plumage is in fine condition when they arrive;
their tail-feathers are then as long as at any other period, and the whole
apparel of the adult birds is as perfect as in the breeding season.
</p>

<p>
On the water, few birds exhibit more graceful motions than the Pintail
Duck. Its delicately slender neck, the beautiful form of its body,
and its pointed tail, which it always carries highly raised, distinguish it
from the other species with which it may associate. There seems also a
kind of natural modesty in it which you do not find in other ducks, and
its notes, which are often heard, are soft and pleasant. That these notes
should ever have been compared to those of the Mallard, appears to me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' href='#Page_215'>215</a></span>
very strange;—so strange that I am tempted to believe that they who
say so must have mistaken Mallards for Pintails.
</p>

<p>
Whilst with us, the Pintail is found in company with the Baldpate
or American Widgeon, the Blue-winged Teal, and the Mallard, more frequently
on ponds than on streams, although it sometimes resorts to the
latter, when their shores are overhung with beech-trees loaded with their
nutritious fruits, of which this species is extremely fond, and in search of
which they even ramble to a short distance into the woods. Were this
duck to feed entirely on beech-nuts, I have no doubt that its flesh would
be excellent. It feeds on tadpoles in spring, and leeches in autumn,
while, during winter, a dead mouse, should it come in its way, is swallowed
with as much avidity as by a Mallard. To these articles of food it adds
insects of all kinds, and, in fact, it is by no means an inexpert fly-catcher.
</p>

<p>
The Pintails are less shy in the Western Country than most species of
their family, and in this respect they resemble the Blue-winged Teals,
which in fact might be called stupid birds with as much propriety as
many others. They swim rather deeply, keep close together, and raise
the hind part of the body like the Mallards; and on the water, on land,
or on the wing, several may generally be killed at a shot. A friend of
mine killed nineteen with two shots of his double-barrelled gun. They
are scarcely nocturnal, but rest much in the middle of the day, basking in
the sunshine whilst on the water, whenever they can indulge in this luxury.
While on ponds, they feed along the most shallow parts, or by the edges;
and if you take my advice, you will never shoot at them while their heads
are at the bottom, and their feet kicking above water. I have several
times, for diversion, done so, but in no instance did I damage a single
individual. But when they raise their heads, you may commit great
havock among them.
</p>

<p>
During heavy rains in winter, or after them, the Pintails are fond of
alighting on our broad prairies, corn-fields and meadows; and in almost
every puddle you may then find them busily engaged. They move over
the ground as swiftly as Wood Ducks, still carrying their tail erect, unless
when seizing an insect that is on wing or resting on a blade of grass.
I knew a particular spot in a corn-field, not many miles from Bayou Sara
in Louisiana, where, even after a shower, I was sure to meet with this species,
and where I could always have produced a good number, had I thought
them likely to be prized at the dinner-table. While I was at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s
in Florida, the Pintails were very numerous. They alighted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
everywhere, and I shot a few in order to satisfy myself that they were of the
same species as those I had been accustomed to see. On one occasion I
shot at a large flock swimming on a shallow pond in a large savannah,
and wounded several, which I was surprised to see diving very expertly
as I waded out for them, this species being by no means addicted to that
practice. Those which I have now and then wounded, while in a boat
and in deep water, soon gave up diving, and surrendered, without exhibiting
any of those feats of cunning performed by other species.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Pintails is very rapid, greatly protracted, and almost
noiseless. They arrive in the Western Country mostly in the dusk of
evening, and alight without much circumspection wherever they find
water. They remain at night in the ponds where they feed, and continue
there generally unless much disturbed. On such occasions they keep in
the middle of the water, to avoid their land enemies; but the Virginian
and Barred Owls not unfrequently surprise them, and force them to rise
or make towards the shore, when they fall a prey to the nocturnal marauders.
In the Middle States, they are highly esteemed for the table.
There they arrive later and retire sooner towards their breeding-places,
than in the country west of the Alleghany Mountains.

Nothing can be more pleasing to an American sportsman, than the
arrival of this beautiful little duck in our Southern or Western States.
There, in the month of September, just as the sun sinks beneath the horizon,
you may find him standing on some mote or embankment of a rice-field
in Carolina, or a neck of land between two large ponds in Kentucky,
his gun loaded with number four, and his dog lying at his feet. He sees
advancing from afar, at a brisk rate, a small dark cloud, which he has
some minutes ago marked and pronounced to be a flock of Green-winged
Teals. Now he squats on his haunches; his dog lies close; and ere another
minute has elapsed, right over his head, but too high to be shot at,
pass the winged travellers. Some of them remember the place well, for
there they have reposed and fed before. Now they wheel, dash irregularly
through the air, sweep in a close body over the watery fields, and in
their course pass near the fatal spot where the gunner anxiously awaits.
Hark, two shots in rapid succession! The troop is in disorder, and the dog
dashes through the water. Here and there lies a Teal, with its legs
quivering; there, one is whirling round in the agonies of death; some,
which are only winged, quickly and in silence make their way towards a
hiding-place, while one, with a single pellet in his head, rises perpendicularly
with uncertain beats, and falls with a splash on the water. The
gunner has charged his tubes, his faithful follower has brought up all
the game, and the frightened Teals have dressed their ranks, and flying
now high, now low, seem curious to see the place where their companions
have been left. Again they fly over the dangerous spot, and again receive
the double shower of shot. Were it not that darkness has now set
in, the carnage might continue until the sportsman should no longer consider
the thinned flock worthy of his notice. In this manner, at the first
arrival of the Green-winged Teal in the Western Country, I have seen
upwards of six dozen shot by a single gunner in the course of one day.
</p>

<p>
I have often thought that water-birds, ducks for example, like land-birds
which migrate in flocks, are very apt to pass over the place where
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
others of the same kind had been before. Pigeons, Starlings, Robins,
and other land-birds are often observed to do so; while Curlews, Cormorants,
Plovers, Ducks and Geese, are similar in this respect. The first
object in view with such species is to remove from one part of the country
to another, as every one knows; and as to reach a place of safety abundantly
supplied with food, is the next object, you may perhaps join me in
concluding, that, to the spot or district in which birds have once been
and spent a season, they are ever afterwards inclined to return. Well,
the Green-wings are known to follow each other in flocks, sometimes consisting
of a few families, sometimes of many hundred individuals, particularly
in autumn, when old and young leave the north to avoid the
rigours of its dreary winter. In spring, again, many species both of land
and water birds perform their migrations, either singly or in smaller
groups, the males departing before the females, and in some cases the
young keeping by themselves, an arrangement perhaps intended for the
greater dispersion of the species.
</p>

<p>
In Louisiana, the Green-winged Teal is named <i>Sarcelle d’hiver</i>, while
the Blue-winged species bears the name of <i>Sarcelle d’été</i>, although the latter
remains only some weeks in that country after the departure of the
former. Its general name, however, is the “Green-wing”: and a poor
name in my opinion it is, for the bird has not more green on its wings
than several other species have. Indeed, very many birds are strangely
named, not less in <i>pure</i> Latin, than in English, French, and Dutch; and
very many are every year receiving names still stranger than those they
bore. For my part, I am at present a kind of conservative, and adhere
to the old system until I see the mud raised up by the waders subside,
when I may probe my way with more chance of success.
</p>

<p>
The Green-winged Teal is a fresh-water bird, being rarely met with
in marine bays, creeks, or lagoons, where, however, it may sometimes
spend a few days. It is accordingly enabled to feed with its body half-immersed,
in the manner of the Mallard and several other species, for
which purpose it is furnished with a comparatively long neck. Its food
consists principally of the seeds of grasses, which are collected either when
floating or when still adhering to their stalks, small acorns, fallen grapes
or berries, as well as aquatic insects, worms, and small snails. I have
never found water lizards, leeches, fishes, or even tadpoles in their gizzards.
The food of this bird being thus more select than that of most
other Ducks, its flesh is delicious, probably the best of any of its tribe;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
and I would readily agree with any epicure in saying, that when it has
fed on wild oats at Green Bay, or on soaked rice in the fields of Georgia
and the Carolinas, for a few weeks after its arrival in those countries, it
is much superior to the Canvass-back in tenderness, juiciness, and flavour.
Indeed, the Green-wing is as much superior to the Canvass-back, as the
European Quail is to the Capercailie, or the Sora of the Delaware to the
Scolopaceous Curlew of the Florida Ever Glades.
</p>

<p>
On land, the Green-wing moves with more ease and grace than any
other species with which I am acquainted, excepting our beautiful Wood
Duck. It can run at a good rate, without entangling its webbed feet, as
many others do; and in this, too, there is a marked difference between
fresh-water and salt-water Ducks, as one may very readily perceive. On
the water, also, it moves with great ease, at times with considerable rapidity,
and when not severely wounded, is able to dive in a very creditable
manner. On wing it has no rivals among Ducks. Our two smaller
Mergansers, however, are swifter, although they exhibit none of the
graceful movements every now and then shewn by the Green-wings, when
coursing in the air over and around a pond, a river, or a large wet savannah.
They rise from the water at a single spring, and so swiftly too,
that none but an expert marksman need attempt to shoot them, if when
starting they are many yards distant. While feeding, they proceed in
a close body along the shores, or wherever the water is so shallow that
they can reach the bottom with ease. In savannahs or watery fields
intersected by dry ridges, they remove from one pool to another on
foot, unless the distance is considerable; and in effecting the transit, they
run so huddled together, as to enable a gunner to make great havock
among them. When the cravings of hunger are satisfied, they retire to
some clean part of the shore, or a sandbar, where they rest in perfect harmony,
each individual composing its dress, and afterwards, with wings
slightly drooping, placing its breast to the sun. There they remain for
an hour or more at a time, some sound asleep, some dosing, but rarely
without a trusty sentinel watching over their safety. In this manner they
spend the winter months in the Southern and Western Countries. There,
indeed, they are far more abundant than in our eastern districts, just because
the climate is milder, the human population more dispersed, and
the damp fields, meadows, and savannahs more abundant.
</p>

<p>
The migrations of this species are performed more over the land than
along the borders of the sea; and it is probable that its principal breeding-places
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
are in the interior of the fur countries; as it has been met there
by Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Parry</span>, Sir <span class="smcap">James Ross</span>, Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, and other
intrepid travellers. Some, however, remain on our great lakes, and I
have seen individuals breeding on the banks of the Wabash, in Illinois,
where I found a female with young, all of which I obtained. It was not
far above Vincennes, and in the month of July. On Lakes Erie and
Michigan, nests containing eggs have also been found; but these may
have been cases in which the birds were unable to proceed farther north,
on account of wounds or other circumstances, or because of the early period
at which they might have paired before the general departure of the
flocks, a cause of detention more common in migratory birds than people
seem to be aware of. These opportunities, few as they were, have enabled
me to see the kinds of places in which the nests were found, the
structure of the nest, the number, size, and colour of the eggs; so that I
have in so far been qualified to draw a comparison between our Green-winged
Teal and that of Europe.
</p>

<p>
The Green-wings leave the neighbourhood of New Orleans in the end
of February; but in the Carolinas they remain until late in March, at
which time also they depart from all the places between the Atlantic and
the States of Kentucky, Indiana, &amp;c. Farther eastward I have seen this
species as late as the 9th of May, when I shot a few not far from Philadelphia.
As you advance farther along our coast, you find it more rare;
and scarcely any are met with near the shores of the British provinces.
In Newfoundland and Labrador, it is never seen. Its migrations southward,
I am satisfied, extend beyond the United States; but their extreme
limits are unknown to me. I have seldom seen it associate with
other species, although I have frequently observed individuals on a pond
or river not far from other Ducks. It is more shy than the Blue-winged
Teal, but less so than most of our other fresh-Water Ducks. Its voice
is seldom heard during winter, except when a flock is passing over another
 that has alighted, when a few of the males call to the voyagers, as
if to invite them to join them. Before they depart, however, they become
noisy. Combats take place among the males; the females are seen
coquetting around them, and most of the birds are paired before they
leave us.
</p>

<p>
In the few instances in which I found the nest of this bird, and they
were only three, it was not placed nearer the water than five or six yards,
and I should not have discovered it had I not first seen the birds swimming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
or washing themselves near the spot. By watching them carefully
I discovered their landing places, and on going up found a path formed,
in a direct line among the rushes. In two cases I came so near the nest,
as almost to touch the sitting bird as it rose affrighted. While it flew
round me, and then alighted on the water, I viewed the nest, with perhaps
more interest than I have felt on most occasions of a like nature.
On a scanty bed of the bird’s own down and feathers, supported by another
of grasses, intermixed with mud and stalks of the plants around,
raised to the height of four or five inches, I found seven eggs in one,
nine in another, and only five in a third. They were all found in the
month of July, and not far from Green Bay. The average measurement
of the eggs was an inch and three quarters by an inch and three-eighths.
They were much rounded, of a dull yellowish colour, indistinctly marked
with a deeper tint, as if soiled. In one of the nests only the eggs were
fresh. I took two of them, which I afterwards ate. Having planted a
stick as a mark of recognition, I visited the nest three days in succession,
but found that the bird had abandoned it; while those of the other two
nests, which were not more than about a hundred yards distant, and
whose eggs I had handled quite as much, although I took none away,
continued to sit. No male birds were to be seen during my stay in that
neighbourhood. I concluded that although the eggs may be touched or
even handled and lifted from the nest, yet if they were all replaced, the
bird did not take umbrage; but that should any of them be missed,
some strong feeling urged her to abandon the rest. Again I thought
that as incubation had just commenced with this bird, she cared less
about her eggs than the other two whose eggs contained chicks.
</p>

<p>
Having met with the young of this species only once, at a time when
I was less aware of the necessity of noting observations in writing, I am
unwilling to speak of their colours from recollection. All I can say is
that I had great trouble in catching four of them, so cunningly did they
hide in the grass, and so expert were they at diving.

The differences between the American and European specimens are so
small that I can find no good reason for considering the birds of the two

wing, which the European bird has not, while the latter has the greater
part of the outer webs of most of the scapulars white, there being none
of that colour on those of our bird. The proportions and size are similar;
and if the two birds are really distinct species, I do not know upon what
circumstances specific distinctions are to be founded.

<h2>
THE SCAUP DUCK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula Marila</i>, Steph.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXIX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
The opinion, derived from <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s account of the Scaup Duck,
that it is met with only along our sea coasts, in bays, or in the mouths of
rivers, as far as the tide extends, is incorrect. Had <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> resided in
the Western Country, or seen our large lakes and broad rivers during
late autumn, winter, or early spring, he would have had ample opportunities
of observing thousands of this species, on the Ohio, the Missouri,
and the Mississippi, from Pittsburg to New Orleans. I have shot a good
number of Scaup Ducks on all these rivers, where I have observed them
to arrive early in October, and whence they depart between the 1st of
March and the middle of April. I have not, however, seen any in small
creeks, lagoons, or ponds. When they arrive on the western waters, they
are seen in flocks of from fifteen to twenty individuals; but in a few
weeks these flocks are joined by others, for which reason the species is
named in Kentucky the “Flocking Fowl.” They are, however, seldom
seen close together while on the water, and they rarely associate with other
birds.
</p>

<p>
The Scaup Duck seems to float less lightly than it really does, its
body being comparatively flat. It moves fast, frequently sipping the
water, as if to ascertain whether its favourite food be in it. Then turning
its head and glancing on either side to assure itself of security, down
it dives with all the agility of a Merganser, and remains a considerable
time below. On emerging, it shakes its head, raises the hind part of its
body, opens its short and rather curved wings, after a few flaps replaces
them, and again dives in search of food. Should any person appear when
it emerges, it swims off to a considerable distance, watches every movement
of the intruder, and finally either returns to its former place, or flies
away.
</p>

<p>
These birds are fond of large eddies below projecting points of land,
but frequently dive in search of food at a considerable distance from
them. When in eddies they may be approached and shot with less difficulty
than when in any other situation. If wounded only, they are not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
easily secured; in fact, you need not go after them, for by diving, fluttering
along the surface, and cutting backward and forward, they generally
elude pursuit. Between Louisville and Shippingport, on the Kentucky
side of the Ohio, the shores are from ten to fifteen feet high, and rather
abrupt when the waters are at their ordinary level. The Scaup Ducks
are fond of diving for food along this place, and there, by coming directly
upon them unseen, till you are almost over them, you may have the very
best opportunities of procuring them. They are not worth shooting,
however, unless for sport or examination, for their flesh is generally tough
and rather fishy in flavour. Indeed I know none, excepting what is called
<i>an Epicure</i>, who could relish a Scaup Duck.
</p>

<p>
They appear to experience some difficulty in getting on wing, and
assist themselves on all occasions, either by meeting the current or fronting
the wind, while they also use their broad feet as helps. When danger
is near, they frequently, however, prefer diving, which they find as
effectual a means of security as flying. As they usually feed at some
distance from each other, it is amusing to see them go off, as they emerge
from the water in succession, and to watch them when they collect again,
and when, after flying for a long time in circles, now high then low over the
water, they all realight. These habits, and the toughness of their sinewy
bodies, render it rather difficult to shoot them. Although flat-billed, they
dive to a considerable depth, and when they have reached the bottom, no
doubt furrow the mud, in the manner of the Shoveller (<i>Anas clypeata</i>),
although the latter performs this action while floating on the surface, with
its head and neck alone submersed, as it swims over the shallows.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Scaup Duck I have found to consist of small fry,
crayfishes, and a mixture of such grasses as here and there grow along
the beds of our rivers. I never found any portions of testaceous mollusca
in the gizzards of those obtained on our western waters, although
even there they might meet with abundance of these animals.
</p>

<p>
When these birds are travelling, their flight is steady, rather laborious,
but greatly protracted. The whistling of their wings is heard at a
considerable distance when they are passing over head. At this time
they usually move in a broad front, sometimes in a continuous line.
When disturbed, they fly straight forward for a while, with less velocity
than when travelling, and, if within proper distance, are easily shot. At
times their notes are shrill, but at others hoarse and guttural. They are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
however rarely heard during the day, and indeed, like many other species,
these birds are partly nocturnal.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of spring the Drakes pay their addresses to the females,
before they set out on their journey. At that period the males
become more active and lively, bowing their heads, opening their broad
bills, and uttering a kind of quack, which to the listener seems produced
by wind in their stomach, but notwithstanding appears to delight their
chosen females.
</p>

<p>
The Scaup Duck varies materially as to size at different ages. Some
wounded individuals which I kept, and which were birds of the first year,
were much larger and heavier at the end of a year; and I agree with my
learned friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, that specimens may be procured measuring
from sixteen and a half to eighteen, nineteen, or twenty inches in length.
</p>

<p>
On the Atlantic coast I have met with this species from the Gulf
of Mexico to the Bay of Fundy, and my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Macculloch</span>
has told me that they are not unfrequent at Pictou in Nova Scotia. Farther
north I saw none; and their breeding places are yet unknown to me.

The female agrees with the male in the characters of the plumage, and
in the colours of the bare parts; but those of the former differ considerably.
The head, neck, and fore part of the back and breast, are umber
brown; and there is a broad patch of white along the fore part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
forehead. The upper parts in general are brownish-black, the middle of
the back and the scapulars undulated with whitish dots and bars. The
primary quills are greyish in the middle, and the speculum is white, but
of less extent than in the male. The greater part of the breast and abdomen
is white; the sides and parts under the tail umber brown.

<p class="p2">
The males, as has been said, vary greatly in size, but in adult specimens
there is little difference in colouring. The birds figured in my Illustrations,

<h2>
THE SANDERLING.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tringa arenaria</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
Although the Sanderling extends its rambles along our Atlantic
shores, from the eastern extremities of Maine to the southernmost Keys of
the Floridas, it is only an autumnal and winter visitor. It arrives in the
more Eastern Districts about the 1st of August, on the sea-shores of New
York and New Jersey rarely before the 10th of August, and seldom reaches
the extensive sand-banks of East Florida previous to the month of November.
Along the whole of this extended coast, it is more or less abundant,
sometimes appearing in bands composed of a few individuals, and at times
in large flocks, but generally mingling with other species of small shore-birds.
Thus I have seen Turnstones and Knots mixed with the Sanderlings,
but in such cases they are perhaps wanderers, which have not succeeded
in meeting with companions of their own species, that associate
with the birds of which I here speak.
</p>

<p>
The Sanderling obtains its food principally by probing the moist
sands of the sea-shores with its bill held in an oblique position. At every
step it inserts this instrument with surprising quickness, to a greater or
less depth, according to the softness of the sand, sometimes introducing
it a quarter of an inch, sometimes to the base. The holes thus made
may be seen on the borders of beaches, when the tide is fast receding, in
rows of twenty, thirty, or more; in certain spots less numerous; for it
appears that when a place proves unproductive of the food for which they
are searching, they very soon take to their wings and remove to another,
now and then in so hurried a manner that one might suppose they had
been suddenly frightened. The contents of the stomach of those which
I shot while thus occupied, were slender sea-worms, about an inch in
length, together with minute shell-fish and gravel. At other times, when
they were seen following the receding waves, and wading up to the belly
in the returning waters, I found in them small shrimps and other crustacea.
</p>

<p>
In their flight the Sanderlings do not perform so many evolutions as
Sandpipers usually display. They generally alight about a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
yards of the place from which they started, and run for a yard or so,
keeping their wings partially extended. They move on the sand with
great activity, running so as to keep pace with a man walking at a moderate
rate. Their flight is rapid and straighter than that of other small
species, and when on wing they seldom exhibit each surface of the body
alternately, as many others are wont to do.
</p>

<p>
I have thought that the migrations of this bird are carried on under
night; but of this I am by no means certain, although I observed some
small flocks, composed of a few dozen individuals, crossing the Gulf of
St Lawrence, at a little height over the water, in the month of June.
The lateness of the season induced me to hope that I might find some
nests of the Sanderling on the coast of Labrador; but in this I was disappointed,
although some young birds were seen at Bras d’Or, in little
parties of four or five individuals. This was early in August, and they
were already on their way southward.
</p>

<p>
The Sanderling affords good eating, especially the young, and the
sportsman may occasionally kill six or seven at a shot, provided he fires
the moment the flock has alighted, for immediately after the birds spread
abroad in search of food.
</p>

<p>
The female may easily be distinguished from the male, by her superior
size; but in the colouring of birds of both sexes, I have observed
as much difference as in the Turnstone. Even during winter, some are
more or less marked with black and brownish-red, while others, which,
however, I easily ascertained to be younger birds, were of an almost uniform
light grey above, each feather edged with dull white; but in all
those which I have examined, whether old birds in the full spring or summer
dress, in which I have shot some in May, in the Middle Districts, or
young birds in autumn and during winter, I have seen no difference in
the colours of the bill, legs, and toes. My plate of this species represents
two birds in winter plumage, which were obtained in East Florida in the
month of December. The figure of a fine male, which, being on another
sheet of paper, was overlooked during my absence from London, you
will find in Plate CCLXXXV. of “The Birds of America.”

<h2>
A RACOON HUNT IN KENTUCKY.
</h2>

<p>
The Racoon, which is a cunning and crafty animal, is found in all
our woods, so that its name is familiar to every child in the Union. The
propensity which it evinces to capture all kinds of birds accessible to it
in its nightly prowlings, for the purpose of feasting on their flesh, induces
me to endeavour to afford you some idea of the pleasure which our western
hunters feel in procuring it. With your leave, then, Reader, I will
take you to a “Coon Hunt.”
</p>

<p>
A few hours ago the sun went down far beyond the “far west.” The
woodland choristers have disappeared, the matron has cradled her babe,
and betaken herself to the spinning-wheel; the woodsman, his sons, and
“the stranger” are chatting before a blazing fire, making wise reflections
on past events, and anticipating those that are to come. Autumn, sallow
and sad, prepares to bow her head to the keen blast of approaching
winter; the corn, though still on its stalk, has lost its blades; the wood
pile is as large as the woodsman’s cabin; the nights have become chill,
and each new morn has effected a gradual change in the dews, which now
crust the withered herbage with a coat of glittering white. The sky is
still cloudless; a thousand twinkling stars reflect their light from the
tranquil waters; all is silent and calm in the forest, save the nightly
prowlers that roam in its recesses. In the cheerful cabin all is happiness;
its inmates generously strive to contribute to the comfort of the stranger
who has chanced to visit them; and, as racoons are abundant in the
neighbourhood, they propose a hunt. The offer is gladly accepted. The
industrious woman leaves her wheel, for she has listened to her husband’s
talk; now she approaches the fire, takes up the board shovel, stirs the
embers, produces a basket filled with sweet potatoes, arranges its contents
side by side in front of the hearth, and covers them with hot ashes and
glowing coals. All this she does, because she “guesses” that hungry stomachs
will be calling for food when the sport is over. Ah! Reader,
what “homely joys” there are in such scenes, and how you would enjoy
them! The rich may produce a better, or a more sumptuous meal; but
his feelings can never be like those of the poor woodsman. Poor I ought
not to call him, for nature and industry bountifully supply all his wants;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
the woods and rivers produce his chief dainties, and his toils are his pleasures.
</p>

<p>
Now mark him! the bold Kentuckian is on his feet; his sons and
the stranger prepare for the march. Horns and rifles are in requisition.
The goodman opens the wooden-hinged door, and sends forth a blast
loud enough to scare a wolf. The racoons scamper away from the cornfields,
break through the fences, and hie to the woods. The hunter has
taken an axe from the wood-pile, and returning, assures us that the night
is clear, and that we shall have rare sport. He blows through his rifle,
to ascertain that it is clear, examines his flint, and thrusts a feather into
the touch-hole. To a leathern bag swung at his side is attached a powder-horn;
his sheathed knife is there also; below hangs a narrow strip of
home-spun linen. He takes from his bag a bullet, pulls with his teeth
the wooden stopper from his powder-horn, lays the ball on one hand, and
with the other pours the powder upon it until it is just overtopped.
Raising the horn to his mouth, he again closes it with the stopper, and
restores it to its place. He introduces the powder into the tube; springs
the box of his gun, greases the “patch” over with some melted tallow, or
damps it; then places it on the honeycombed muzzle of his piece. The
bullet is placed on the patch over the bore, and pressed with the handle of
the knife, which now trims the edges of the linen. The elastic hickory
rod, held with both hands, smoothly pushes the ball to its bed: once,
twice, thrice has it rebounded. The rifle leaps as it were into the hunter’s
arms, the feather is drawn from the touch-hole, the powder fills the
pan, which is closed. “Now I’m ready,” cries the woodsman. His companions
say the same. Hardly more than a minute has elapsed. I wish,
Reader, you had seen this fine fellow—but hark! the dogs are barking.
</p>

<p>
All is now bustle within and without: a servant lights a torch, and
off we march to the woods. “Don’t mind the boys, my dear sir,” says
the woodsman, “follow me close, for the ground is covered with logs, and
the grape vines hang everywhere across.” “Toby, hold up the light,
man, or we’ll never see the gullies.” “Trail your gun, sir, as General
<span class="smcap">Clark</span> used to say,—not so, but this way—that’s it; now then, no danger
you see; no fear of snakes, poor things! They are stiff enough, I’ll
be bound. The dogs have treed one. Toby, you old fool, why don’t
you turn to the right—not so much there—go a-head, and give us light—What’s
that?—Who’s there?—Ah, you young rascals! you’ve played
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
us a trick, have you. It’s all well enough, but now, just keep behind,
or I’ll”—and in fact, the boys, with eyes good enough to see in the
dark, although not quite so well as an Owl’s, had cut directly across the
dogs, which had surprised a racoon on the ground and bayed it, until the
lads knocked it on the head. “Seek him, boys,” cries the hunter.—The
dogs, putting their noses to the ground, pushed off at a good rate.
“Master, they’re making for the creek,” says old Toby. On towards it
therefore we push. What woods, to be sure! No gentleman’s park this,
I assure you, Reader. We are now in a low flat; the soil thinly covers
the hard clay; nothing but beech trees hereabouts, unless now and then
a maple. Hang the limbs! say I—hang the supple-jacks too—here I
am, fast by the neck—cut it with your knife. My knee has had a tremendous
rub against a log—now, my foot is jammed between two roots—and
here I stick. “Toby, come back—don’t you know the stranger
is not up to the woods. Halloo, Toby, Toby!” There I stood perfectly
shackled, the hunter laughing heartily, and the lads glad of an opportunity
of slipping off. Toby arrived, and held the torch near the ground, on
which the hunter cutting one of the roots with his hatchet, set me free.
“Are you hurt, Sir?”—no, not in the least. Off we start again. The
boys had got up with the dogs, which were baying a Racoon in a small
puddle. We soon joined them with the light. “Now, stranger! watch and
see!” The Racoon was all but swimming, and yet had hold of the bottom
of the pool with his feet. The glare of the lighted torch was doubtless
distressing to him; his coat was ruffled, and his rounded tail seemed
thrice its ordinary size, his eyes shone like emeralds; with foaming jaws
he watched the dogs, ready to seize each by the snout if it came within
reach. They kept him busy for several minutes; the water became thick
with mud; his coat now hung dripping, and his draggled tail lay floating
on the surface. His guttural growlings, in place of intimidating his assailants,
excited them the more; and they very unceremoniously closed
upon him, curs as they were, and without the breeding of gentle dogs!
One seized him by the rump and tugged, but was soon forced to let go;
another stuck to his side, but soon taking a better directed bite of his
muzzle than another dog had just done of his tail, coon made him yelp;
and pitiful were the cries of luckless Tyke. The Racoon would not
let go, but in the mean time the other dogs seized him fast, and worried
him to death, yet to the last he held by his antagonist’s snout. Knocked
on the head by an axe, he lay gasping his last breath, and the heaving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
of his chest was painful to see. The hunters stood gazing at him in the
pool, while all around was by the flare of the torch rendered trebly dark
and dismal. It was a good scene for a skilful painter.
</p>

<p>
We had now two coons, whose furs were worth two quarters of a dollar,
and whose bodies, which I must not forget, as Toby informed us,
would produce two more. “What now,” I asked—“What now,” quoth
the father, “why go after more to be sure.” So we did, the dogs ahead,
and I far behind. In a short time the curs treed another, and when we
came up, we found them seated on their haunches, looking upwards, and
barking. The hunters now employed their axes, and sent the chips about
at such a rate that one of them coming in contact with my cheek marked
it so, that a week after several of my friends asked me where, in the name
of wonder, I had got that black eye. At length the tree began to crack,
and slowly leaning to one side, the heavy mass swung rustling through
the air, and fell to the earth with a crash. It was not one coon that was
surprised here, but three—aye three of them, one of which, more crafty
than the rest, leaped fairly from the main top while the tree was staggering.
The other two stuck to the hollow of a branch, from which they
were soon driven by one of the dogs. Tyke and Lion having nosed the
cunning old one, scampered after him, not mouthing like the well-trained
hounds of our southern fox hunters, but yelling like furies. The hunter’s
sons attacked those on the tree, while the woodsman and I, preceded
by Toby, made after the other; and busy enough we all were. Our
animal was of extraordinary size, and after some parley, a rifle ball was
sent through his brain. He reeled once only,—next moment he lay dead.
The rest were dispatched by the axe and the club, for a shot in those days
was too valuable to be spent when it could be saved. It could procure
a deer, and therefore was worth more than a coon’s skin.
</p>

<p>
Now, look at the moon! how full and clear has she risen on the Racoon
hunters! Now is the time for sport! Onward we go, one following
the long shadow of his precursor. The twigs are no impediment,
and we move at a brisker pace, as we return to the hills. What a hue
and cry!—here are the dogs. Overhead and all around, on the forks of
each tree, the hunter’s keen eye searches for something round, which is
likely to prove a coiled up Racoon. There’s one! Between me and the
moon I spied the cunning thing crouched in silence. After taking aim,
I raise my barrel ever so little, the trigger is pressed; down falls the Racoon
to the ground. Another and another are on the same tree. Off
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
goes a bullet, then a second; and we secure the prey. “Let us go home,
stranger,” says the woodsman; and contented with our sport, towards his
cabin we trudge. On arriving there, we find a cheerful fire. Toby stays
without, prepares the game, stretches the skins on a frame of cane, and
washes the bodies. The table is already set; the cake and the potatoes
are all well done; four bowls of butter-milk are ranged in order; and
now the hunters fall to.
</p>

<p>
The Racoon is a cunning animal, and makes a pleasant pet. Monkey-like,
it is quite dexterous in the use of its fore feet, and it will amble after
its master, in the manner of a bear, and even follow him into the street.
It is fond of eggs, but prefers them raw, and it matters not whether it be
morning, noon, or night, when it finds a dozen in the pheasant’s nest, or
one placed in your pocket to please him. He knows the habits of mussels
better than most conchologists. Being an expert climber, he ascends to
the hole of the woodpecker, and devours the young birds. He knows,
too, how to watch the soft-shelled turtle’s crawl, and, better still, how to
dig up her eggs. Now by the edge of the pond, grimalkin-like, he lies
seemingly asleep, until the summer-duck comes within reach. No Negro
knows better when the corn is juicy and pleasant to eat; and although
squirrels and woodpeckers know this too, the Racoon is found in the corn-field
longer in the season than any of them, the havock he commits there
amounting to a tithe. His fur is good in winter, and many think his flesh
good also; but for my part I prefer a live Racoon to a dead one, and
should find more pleasure in hunting one than in eating him.

<h2>
THE LONG-BILLED CURLEW.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Numenius longirostris</i>, Wils.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXI. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Long-billed Curlew is a constant resident in the southern districts
of the United States, whereas the other species are only autumnal
and winter visitors. It is well known by the inhabitants of Charleston
that it breeds on the islands on the coast of South Carolina; and my
friend the Reverend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has been at their breeding grounds.
That some individuals go far north to breed, is possible enough, but we
have no authentic account of such an occurrence, although many <i>suppositions</i>
have been recorded. All that I have to say on this subject is, that
the bird in question is quite unknown in the Magdeleine Islands, where,
notwithstanding the assertions of the fishermen, they acknowledged that
they had mistaken Godwits for Curlews. In Newfoundland, I met with
a well-informed English gentleman, who had resided in that island upwards
of twenty years, and described the Common Curlew of Europe
with accuracy, but who assured me that he had observed only two species
of Curlew there, one about the size of the Whimbrel—the <i>Numenius
hudsonicus</i>, the other smaller—the <i>N. borealis</i>, and that only in August
and the beginning of September, when they spend a few days in that
country, feed on berries, and then retire southward. Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span> of Labrador,
and his brother-in-law, who is a Scotch gentleman, a scholar, and
a sportsman, gave me the same account. None of my party observed an
individual of the species in the course of our three months’ stay in the
country, although we saw great numbers of the true Esquimaux Curlew,
<i>N. borealis</i>. Yet I would not have you to suppose that I do not give
credit to the reports of some travellers, who have said that the Long-billed
Curlew is found in the fur countries during summer. This may be true
enough; but none of the great northern travellers, such as <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>,
<span class="smcap">Ross</span>, <span class="smcap">Parry</span>, or <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>, have asserted this as a fact. Therefore if
the bird of which I speak has been seen far north, it was in all probability
a few stragglers that had perhaps been enticed to follow some other
species. I am well aware of the propensity it has to ramble, as I have
shot some in Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Mississippi;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
but the birds thus obtained were rare in those districts, where the species
only appears at remote periods; and in every instance of the kind I have
found the individuals much less shy than usual, and apparently more perplexed
than frightened by the sight of man.
</p>

<p>
Until my learned friend, Prince <span class="smcap">Charles Bonaparte</span>, corrected the
errors which had been made respecting the Curlews of North America,
hardly one of these birds was known from another by any naturalist,
American or European. To <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, however, is due the merit of having
first published an account of the Long-billed Curlew as a species distinct
from the Common Curlew of Europe.
</p>

<p>
This bird is the largest of the genus found in North America. The
great length of its bill is of itself sufficient to distinguish it from every
other. The bill, however, in all the species, differs greatly, according
to the age of the individual, and in the present Curlew I have seen it
in some birds nearly three inches shorter than in others, although all
were full grown. In many of its habits, the Long-billed Curlew is closely
allied to the smaller species of Ibis; its flight and manner of feeding are
similar, and it has the same number of eggs. Unlike the Ibis, however,
which always breeds on trees, and forms a large nest, the Curlew breeds
on the ground, forming a scanty receptacle for its eggs; yet, according
to my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, the latter, like the former, places its nests “so
close together, that it is almost impossible for a man to walk between
them, without injuring the eggs.”
</p>

<p>
The Long-billed Curlew spends the day in the sea-marshes, from
which it returns at the approach of night, to the sandy beaches of the
sea-shores, where it rests until dawn. As the sun sinks beneath the horizon,
the Curlews rise from their feeding-grounds in small parties, seldom
exceeding fifteen or twenty, and more usually composed of only five or
six individuals. The flocks enlarge, however, as they proceed, and in
the course of an hour or so the number of birds that collect in the place
selected for their nightly retreat, sometimes amounts to several thousands.
As it was my good fortune to witness their departures and arrivals, in the
company of my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, I will here describe them.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by several friends, I left Charleston one beautiful morning,
the 10th of November 1831, with a view to visit Cole’s Island, about
twenty miles distant. Our crew was good, and although our pilot knew
but little of the cuttings in and out of the numerous inlets and channels in
our way, we reached the island about noon. After shooting various birds,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
examining the island, and depositing our provisions in a small summer
habitation then untenanted, we separated; some of the servants went off
to fish, others to gather oysters, and the gunners placed themselves in readiness
for the arrival of the Curlews. The sun at length sunk beneath
the water-line that here formed the horizon; and we saw the birds making
their first appearance. They were in small parties of two, three, or five,
and by no means shy. These seemed to be the birds which we had observed
near the salt-marshes, as we were on our way. As the twilight
became darker the number of Curlews increased, and the flocks approached
in quicker succession, until they appeared to form a continuous procession,
moving not in lines, one after another, but in an extended mass,
and with considerable regularity, at a height of not more than thirty
yards, the individuals being a few feet apart. Not a single note or cry
was heard as they advanced. They moved for ten or more yards with
regular flappings, and then sailed for a few seconds, as is invariably the
mode of flight of this species, their long bills and legs stretched out to
their full extent. They flew directly towards their place of rest, called
the “Bird Banks,” and were seen to alight without performing any of the
evolutions which they exhibit when at their feeding-places, for they had
not been disturbed that season. But when we followed them to the Bird
Banks, which are sandy islands of small extent, the moment they saw us
land the congregated flocks, probably amounting to several thousand individuals
all standing close together, rose at once, performed a few evolutions
in perfect silence, and re-alighted as if with one accord on the extreme
margins of the sand-bank close to tremendous breakers. It was
now dark, and we left the place, although some flocks were still arriving.
The next morning we returned a little before day; but again as we
landed, they all rose a few yards in the air, separated into numerous parties,
and dispersing in various directions, flew off towards their feeding-grounds,
keeping low over the waters, until they reached the shores, when
they ascended to the height of about a hundred yards, and soon disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Now, Reader, allow me to say a few words respecting our lodgings.
Fish, fowl, and oysters had been procured in abundance; and besides
these delicacies, we had taken with us from Charleston some steaks of
beef, and a sufficiency of good beverage. But we had no cook, save your
humble servant. A blazing fire warmed and lighted our only apartment.
The oysters and fish were thrown on the hot embers; the steaks we stuck
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
on sticks in front of them; and ere long every one felt perfectly contented.
It is true we had forgotten to bring salt with us; but I soon proved to
my merry companions that hunters can find a good substitute in their
powder-flasks. Our salt on this occasion was gunpowder, as it has been
with me many a time; and to our keen appetites, the steaks thus salted
were quite as savoury as any of us ever found the best cooked at home.
Our fingers and mouths, no doubt, bore marks of the “villanous saltpetre,”
or rather of the charcoal with which it was mixed, for plates or
forks we had none; but this only increased our mirth. Supper over, we
spread out our blankets on the log floor, extended ourselves on them with
our feet towards the fire, and our arms under our heads for pillows. I
need not tell you how soundly we slept.
</p>

<p>
The Long-billed Curlews are in general easily shot, but take a good
charge. So long as life remains in them, they skulk off among the thickest
plants, remaining perfectly silent. Should they fall on the water,
they swim towards the shore. The birds that may have been in company
with a wounded one fly off uttering a few loud whistling notes. In
this respect, the species differs from all the others, which commonly remain
and fly about you. When on land, they are extremely wary; and
unless the plants are high, and you can conceal yourself from them, it is
very difficult to get near enough. Some one of the flock, acting as sentinel,
raises his wings, as if about to fly, and sounds a note of alarm, on
which they all raise their wings, close them again, give over feeding, and
watch all your motions. At times a single step made by you beyond a
certain distance is quite enough to raise them, and the moment it takes
place, they all scream and fly off. You need not follow the flock. The
best mode of shooting them is to watch their course for several evenings
in succession; for after having chosen a resting place, they are sure to
return to it by the same route, until greatly annoyed.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Long-billed Curlews consists principally of the small
crabs called fiddlers, which they seize by running after them, or by pulling
them out of their burrows. They probe the wet sand to the full
length of their bill, in quest of sea-worms and other animals. They are
also fond of small salt-water shell-fish, insects, and worms of any kind;
but I have never seen them searching for berries on elevated lands, as
the Esquimaux Curlews are wont to do. Their flesh is by no means so
delicate as that of the species just mentioned, for it has usually a fishy
taste, and is rarely tender, although many persons consider it good. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
are sold at all seasons in the markets of Charleston, at about twenty-five
cents the pair.
</p>

<p>
Rambling birds of this species are sometimes seen as far as the neighbourhood
of Boston; for my learned friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> says in his
Manual, that “they get so remarkably fat, at times, as to burst the skin
in falling to the ground, and are then superior in flavour to almost any
other game bird of the season. In the market of Boston, they are seen
as early as the 8th of August.” I found them rather rare in East Florida
in winter and spring. They were there seen either on large savannahs,
or along the sea shore, mixed with marbled Godwits, Tell-tales, and other
species.

<h2>
THE HOODED MERGANSER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Mergus cucullatus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Excepting the Smew or White Nun, the Hooded Merganser is the
handsomest of its family. Its broad and rounded crest of pure white,
with an edging of jetty black, and which it closes or spreads out at pleasure,
renders the male of this species conspicuous on the waters to which
it resorts. The activity of its motions, the rapidity of its flight, and its
other habits, contribute to render it a pleasing object to the student of
nature, not less than to the sportsman. Its flesh, however, has a fishy
taste and odour, although it is relished by some persons. It seems to prefer
fresh water, and is by no means very frequent along the sea coast.
Long, narrow, and moderately deep creeks, or small ponds, are more frequented
by it than large rivers or lakes.
</p>

<p>
On the waters of the Western and Southern States, these Mergansers
are seen to arrive from the north early in October, but generally later
than many species of Ducks, although sooner than either the Red-breasted
Merganser or the Goosander. At the approach of night, a person standing
still on the banks of such a river as the Ohio, first hears the well-known
sound of wings whistling through the air, presently after, a different
noise, as if produced by an eagle stooping on her prey, when gliding
downwards with the rapidity of an arrow, he dimly perceives the Hooded
Mergansers sweeping past. Five or six, perhaps ten, there are; with
quick beats of their pinions, they fly low over the waters in wide circles.
Now they have spied the entrance of a creek; there they shoot into it,
and in a few seconds you hear the rushing noise which they make as they
alight on the bosom of the still pool. How often have I enjoyed such
scenes, when enticed abroad by the clear light of the silvery moon, I have
wandered on the shores of <i>la belle rivière</i>, to indulge in the contemplation
of nature!
</p>

<p>
Up the creek the Mergansers proceed, washing their bodies by short
plunges, and splashing up the water about them. Then they plume themselves,
and anoint their feathers, now and then emitting a low grunting
note of pleasure. And now they dive in search of minnows, which they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
find in abundance, and which no doubt prove delicious food to the hungry
travellers. At length, having satisfied their appetite, they rise on
wing, fly low over the creek with almost incredible velocity, return to the
broad stream, rove along its margin until they meet with a clean sand-beach,
where they alight, and where, secure from danger, they repose until
the return of day. A sly Racoon may, when in search of mussels,
chance to meet with the sleeping birds, and surprise one of them; but
this rarely happens, for they are as wary and vigilant as their enemy is
cunning, and were the prowler to depend upon Hooded Mergansers for
food, he would be lean enough.
</p>

<p>
This bird ranges throughout the United States during winter, content
with the food it meets with in the bays and estuaries of the eastern coast,
and on the inland streams. The dam of the Pennsylvania miller is as
agreeable to it as that of the Carolina rice-planter. The Le High and
Brandy-wine Creek have their fishes, as well as the waters of Bear Grass
or Bayou Sara. Nay, the numerous streams and pools of the interior of
the Floridas are resorted to by this species, and there I have found them
full of life and gaiety, as well as on the Missouri, and on our great lakes.
When the weather proves too cold for them they move southwards many
of them removing towards Mexico.
</p>

<p>
The Hooded Merganser is a most expert diver, and so vigilant that
at times it escapes even from the best percussion gun. As to shooting at
it with a flint lock, you may save yourself the trouble unless you prevent
it from seeing the flash of the pan. If you wound one, never follow it:
the bird, when its strength is almost exhausted, immerses its body, raises
the point of its bill above the surface, and in this manner makes its way
among the plants, until finding some safe retreat along the shore, it betakes
itself to it, and there remains, so that you may search for it in vain,
unless you have a good dog. Even on wing it is not easily shot. If on
a creek ever so narrow, it will fly directly towards its mouth, although
you may be standing knee-deep in the middle. It comes up like a ball,
rises and passes over head with astonishing speed, and if you shoot at it,
do not calculate upon a hit. You may guess how many one may shoot
in a day.
</p>

<p>
When I removed from Pennsylvania to Kentucky, the Hooded Merganser
was not uncommon in the neighbourhood of Louisville during
summer, and I told <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> so. On several occasions I caught the
young with a partridge net; and let me assure you, Reader, that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
are not yellow, as is alleged by some writers, but very dark brown.
Even when feathered they retain the same colour until the beginning of
August, when they gradually change it for the dress of the adult female.
</p>

<p>
Like all the rest of the tribe, which, when far north, for the want of
hollow trees, breed on the moss or ground, the Hooded Mergansers that
remain with us nestle in the same kind of holes or hollows as the Wood
Ducks; at least I have found their nests in such situations seven or eight
times, although I never saw one of them alight on the branch of a tree,
as the birds just mentioned are wont to do. They dive as it were directly
into their wooden burrows, where on a few dried weeds and feathers of
different kinds, with a small quantity of down from the breast of the female,
the eggs are deposited. They are from five to eight, measure one
inch and three-fourths by one and three-eighths, and in other respects
perfectly resemble those of the Red-breasted Merganser.
</p>

<p>
The young, like those of the Wood Duck, are conveyed to the water
by their mother, who carries them gently in her bill; for the male takes
no part in providing for his offspring, but abandons his mate as soon as
incubation has commenced. The affectionate mother leads her young
among the tall rank grasses which fill the shallow pools or the borders of
creeks, and teaches them to procure snails, tadpoles, and insects. The eggs
are laid in May, and the young are out some time in June. On two occasions
the parents would not abandon the young, although I expected
that the noises which I made would have induced them to do so: they
both followed their offspring into the net which I had set for them. The
young all died in two days, when I restored the old birds to liberty.
</p>

<p>
The Hooded Merganser, as well as all the other species with which I
am acquainted, moves with ease on the ground, nay even runs with speed.
Those which leave the United States, take their departure from the first
of March to the middle of May; and I am induced to believe that probably
one-third of them tarry for the purpose of breeding on the margins
of several of our great lakes. When migrating, they fly at a great height,
in small loose flocks, without any regard to order. Their notes consist
of a kind of rough grunt, variously modulated, but by no means musical,
and resembling the syllables <i>croo, croo, crooh</i>. The female repeats it six
or seven times in succession, when she sees her young in danger. The
same noise is made by the male, either when courting on the water, or as
he passes on wing near the hole where the female is laying one of her
eggs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The males do not acquire the full beauty of their plumage until the
third spring, but resemble the females for the first year. In the course
of the second, the crest becomes more developed, and the white and black
markings about the head and body are more distinct. The third spring
they are complete, such as you see the bird represented in the plate.

THE SORA RAIL.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXIII. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
Not many years have elapsed since it was supposed by some of the
inhabitants of those districts to which thousands of this species of Rail
resort at particular periods, that the Soras buried themselves in the mud
at the approach of cold weather, for the purpose of there spending the
winter in a state of torpidity. Many wonderful tales were circulated to
convince the world of the truth of this alleged phenomenon; but the fact
was, as you will naturally anticipate, that the birds merely shifted their
quarters, as no doubt they will continue to do, so long as the climate becomes
too cold for them in winter. Prior to the days of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, very
little indeed had been published respecting the habits of our birds. Superstitious
notions and absurd fancies occupied the place of accurate
knowledge in the minds of people too earnestly engaged in more important
pursuits, to attend to the history of the animals around them; and
with respect to the Sora in particular, I have no doubt that the settlers
in our original forests cared very little about them, farther than that,
when well cooked, they afforded a very savoury dish. Now, however,
the case is very different. Many of the enterprising and industrious sons
of Columbia have attained affluence and ease, and their children receive
a liberal education. The sciences and arts, those attendants on peaceful
commerce, are now sources of pleasure to many of our citizens, and at the
present day there are not a few individuals among us, devotedly engaged
in the pursuit of zoology in all its branches. So rapid has been the progress
of ornithology in particular, that I should hesitate before asserting
that any American, however uncultured, now believes that Rails burrow
in the mud.
</p>

<p>
Those who have studied the habits of our birds, or of those of any part
of the world, no longer admit that Swallows are condemned to search for
warmth under the ice; for we have proofs that these birds can with ease obtain
all that is necessary for their comfortable subsistence, by removing on
wing to a warmer region. The Soras and many other species of birds are
similar in this respect to the Swallows. The Vulture that was supposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
to scent his food from afar, has well nigh lost his olfactory powers.
Geese are no longer the offspring of sea-shells; nor do Swans now chaunt
their own requiem. The Pelican, too, has ceased to tear its own breast
to gorge its voracious young. Students of nature have gradually rectified
the various errors into which our ancestors had fallen; and we should
now just as readily expect to see a shoal of fishes issuing from beneath
the plough, as to see a flock of Rails emerge from the mud, shake themselves,
and fly off. This subject, then, being disposed of, I have now to
relate to you the result of my observations on the habits of the Sora.
</p>

<p>
This bird, which I think might have been named the Pennsylvanian
or Virginian Rail, enters the Union from the shores of Mexico, early in
March, when many are to be seen in the markets of New Orleans. Some
reach their northern destination by ascending along the margins of our
western streams, or by crossing the country directly, in the manner of the
Woodcock; while those which proceed along the coast shorten their journey
as much as possible by flying across the headlands of the numerous
inlets or bays of our southern districts, retiring or advancing more slowly
according to the state of the weather. Thus, those which cross the peninsula
of Florida, through the marshes and lagoons that lead to the head
waters of the St John’s River, instead of travelling round the shores of
Georgia and South Carolina, fly directly across towards Cape Lookout.
It it nevertheless true, that a certain number of these birds follow the sinuosities
of the shores, for I found some in the markets of Charleston, in
the month of April, that had been killed in the immediate neighbourhood
of that city, and I obtained others in various parts; but the number of
these is very small compared with that of those which cross at once.
When their passage takes place, either during calm weather or with a
favourable wind, the fortunate travellers pursue their journey by entering
Pimlico Sound, and following the inner margins of the outward banks of
this part of the coast until they reach Cape Henry. From thence some
ascend the Chesapeake, while others make for the mouth of the Delaware,
and these perhaps again meet on the borders of Lake Ontario, or the waters
of the St Lawrence, after which they soon enter those portions of the
country in which they breed, and spend a short but agreeable season.
</p>

<p>
Every person acquainted with the general movements of birds either
during spring, when they pass northwards, or the autumnal months, when
they are on their way to milder climes, is aware that, at the former period,
their anxiety to reach the place of breeding is much greater than that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
which they feel at any other period. Thus, in its movement southward,
the Sora, like all other Rails, when returning with its progeny, which are
yet feeble and unable to undergo much fatigue, proceeds considerably
slower than in spring. Hence its appearance in autumn, in multitudes,
in various places, where it is enticed by an abundance of food and comparative
security, to tarry for some time, and recruit its strength. Thus,
in September and part of October, the Sora is found in great numbers on
the borders of our great lakes, feeding on wild oats, and on the reedy
margins of the rivers of our Middle Districts. Several natural causes
prevent birds of this species from following the sea-coast of the United
States, while migrating either in spring or in autumn, the principal of
which is the absence there of their favourite Zizania marshes, which are
but very rarely met with to the east of the State of New York. This is
probably the cause of the great rarity of this species in Massachusetts,
whilst, so far as I know, none are ever found to the eastward of that
State. These observations are corroborated by those of my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas
MacCulloch</span> of Pictou, who never met with one of these birds during
many years’ residence in that part of Nova Scotia.
</p>

<p>
Having seen flocks of Soras winging their way close over the waters
of the Gulf of Mexico, and between Cape Florida and the main shores
of the Carolinas, in the month of April, when they were moving directly
towards Cape Lookout, I have very little doubt that many return
in the same track, in the end of October, when the young, well fed and
strengthened, are able to follow their parents on wing, even across that
large extent of water. I shall now dismiss this part of the subject, by
adding, in confirmation of their capability of protracted flight, that some
of these birds, when accidentally separated from their flock, have supported
themselves on wing until they have met with vessels several hundred
miles from land; and facts of this kind have been announced by
persons of well known respectability.
</p>

<p>
During the autumnal months, a goodly number of Soras are found in
the rice-fields and fresh-water marshes of the Carolinas. Sometimes also
they have been shot in salt-water marshes, in spring, while on their northward
migration. At this period they are very silent, until forced to fly.
In those States none are seen during summer. Very few, it appears, remain
in any part of the Middle Districts. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>,
however, was shewn some eggs of this bird, that had been found in the
meadows below Philadelphia; and whilst I was in the company of my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, Esq. on a woodcock shooting expedition, my
son shot some young birds scarcely fledged, and shortly afterwards an
adult female. <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> met with a nest on the shore of the Hudson,
and I saw two in the marshes of Lake Champlain.
</p>

<p>
Fond of concealment, as all its tribe are, the Sora is rarely seen during
day, although, being seminocturnal, it skulks amid the tall reeds or
grasses, both by day and at night, in search of its food. Differing, however,
in habit, as well as in form, from the Gallinules, it rarely abandons
the retreats which it has chosen after the breeding season, and rises, when
forced by tides, to the tops of the plants about it, climbing along or
clinging to their stalks or leaves, with as much ease as it walks on the
floating garbage, when persons in boats can see them without any difficulty.
Whenever these occurrences take place, and the country around
is thickly peopled, great havock is made among them. This particularly
happens on the James and Delaware rivers, where thousands are annually
destroyed during their autumnal stay. The sport of shooting Soras is
much akin to that of shooting Clapper Rails, or Salt-Water-Marsh-Hens,
which I have already described. But Wilson having given an account
of it, as pursued when Soras were much more abundant than I ever saw
them, I shall transcribe his description of the manner adopted by the
sportsmen on the Delaware.
</p>

<p>
“The usual method of shooting them, in this quarter of the country,
is as follows:—The sportsman furnishes himself with a light batteau, and
a stout experienced boatman, with a pole of twelve or fifteen feet long,
thickened at the lower end to prevent it from sinking too deep into the mud.
About two hours or so before high water, they enter the reeds, and each
takes his post, the sportsman standing in the bow ready for action, the
boatman, on the stern seat, pushing her steadily through the reeds. The
Rail generally spring singly, as the boat advances, and at a short distance
ahead, are instantly shot down, while the boatman, keeping his eye on
the spot where the bird fell, directs the boat forward, and picks it up as
the gunner is loading. It is also the boatman’s business to keep a sharp
look-out, and give the word ‘mark!’ when a Rail springs on either side
without being observed by the sportsman, and to note the exact spot
where it falls until he has picked it up; for this once lost sight of, owing
to the sameness in the appearance of the reeds, is seldom found again.
In this manner the boat moves steadily through and over the reeds, the
birds flushing and falling, the gunner loading and firing, while the boatman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
is pushing and picking up. The sport continues till an hour or two
after high water, when the shallowness of the water, and the strength and
weight of the floating reeds, as also the backwardness of the game to
spring as the tide decreases, oblige them to return. Several boats are
sometimes within a short distance of each other, and a perpetual cracking
of musketry prevails along the whole reedy shores of the river. In these
excursions it is not uncommon for an active and expert marksman to kill
ten or twelve dozen in a tide. They are usually shot singly, though I
have known five killed at one discharge of a double-barrelled piece. These
instances, however, are rare.”
</p>

<p>
“Such is the mode of Rail shooting in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia.
In Virginia, particularly along the shores of James River, within
the tide water, where the Rail or Sora are in prodigious numbers, they
are also shot on the wing, but more usually taken at night in the following
manner:—A kind of iron grate is fixed on the top of a stout pole,
which is placed like a mast, in a light canoe, and filled with fire. The
darker the night the more successful is the sport. The person who
manages the canoe is provided with a light paddle, ten or twelve feet in
length, and, about an hour before high water, proceeds through among
the reeds, which lie broken and floating on the surface. The whole
space, for a considerable way round the canoe, is completely enlightened,
the birds stare with astonishment, and, as they appear, are knocked on
the head with the paddle, and thrown into the canoe. In this manner,
from twenty to eighty dozen have been killed by three Negroes in the
short space of three hours!”
</p>

<p>
The flight of this little bird while migrating is low, and performed
with a constant beating of the wings, as in the Coot and other birds of
its kind. They pass swiftly along in compact flocks of from five to a
hundred or more individuals. At times you see them rise in a long
curve, as if they had perceived some dangerous object beneath them; then
resume their ordinary direct flight, and are soon out of sight. On the
contrary, when they are with us in autumn, they seem far from being
alert on wing, flying slowly with dangling legs, and proceeding only to a
short distance, when they drop among the reeds with their wings extended,
as if they had been shot. If raised two or three times, it is extremely
difficult to see them again; for on such occasions they will rather dive
and hide under some floating weeds, keeping their bill only above the
water. When walking leisurely, they throw up the tail, in the manner
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
of Gallinules, and if they apprehend danger in consequence of any suspicious
sight or sound, they run off with great speed. Their notes are
shrill and short, but reiterated, like those of <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, although
by no means so loud and disagreeable. When wounded they dive well
at the approach of the sportsman, and sometimes cling to the roots of the
grasses for a few moments, but more usually rise under the cover of the
floating leaves. Some persons still believe that these birds cannot be
drowned; and this notion tempted my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> to make
the experiment. In a note of his now before me, he says:—“I once, in
company with some naturalists of Philadelphia, tried two experiments
upon two Soras that had been slightly wounded in the wing, to ascertain
how long they could live under the water. They were placed in a covered
basket, which was sunk in the river. One remained fifteen, the other
eight minutes, under water; and on being taken out, they were both
found dead. We placed them in the sun for several days, but, I need
hardly say, they did not revive.”
</p>

<p>
The most curious habit or instinct of this species is the nicety of sense
by which they can ascertain the last moment they can remain at any of
the feeding grounds at which they tarry in autumn. One day, you may
see or hear the Soras in their favourite marshes, you may be aware of
their presence in the dusk of evening; but when you return to the place
early next morning, they are all gone. Yesterday the weather was mild,
to-day it is cold and raw; and no doubt the Soras were aware that a
change was at hand, and secured themselves from its influence by a prompt
movement under night. It is probable that these sudden removals gave
rise to the idea of their diving into the mud.

<h2>
THE RING-NECKED DUCK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula rufitorques</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXIV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Ring-necked Duck is abundant on all our western waters during
autumn and winter. It is also met with along our Atlantic coasts; but
there, although I have seen many individuals on the Chesapeake and
other large arms of the sea, it is by no means so plentiful as in the interior.
Its flesh is excellent, equalling in my opinion that of any other
duck; and when it has been feeding along the margins of rivers, creeks,
or ponds for a few weeks, it becomes very fat, tender, and juicy, and has
none of the fishy flavour of those species which are in the habit of diving
deep for their food. In shape, the Tufted Duck, or Ring-bill, as it is
called in Kentucky, resembles the Scaup or Flocking Fowl, but is plumper
and more rounded.
</p>

<p>
This bird arrives in Kentucky and the neighbouring States, as far
down the Mississippi as New Orleans, from the 20th of September to the
middle of October, at which latter period it may be found in the whole
extent of the Union, from Massachusetts to Louisiana, being more numerous
in some districts than in others, according to the suitableness of the
place. They commonly move while on wing in flocks of from fifteen to
twenty individuals, keeping rather scattered, and thus rarely affording
what is called a good shot. They fly with rapidity, keeping at a considerable
height, and the motion of their wings produces a constant whistling
as they pass over head. Before alighting, they wheel and perform
various evolutions, although they do not occupy so much time with them
as Teals are wont to do.
</p>

<p>
They swim rather lightly and with ease, and, unlike the Scaups, experience
no difficulty in rising on wing, whether from the land or from
the water, but generally spring up at once, especially if alarmed. They
have an almost constant practice of raising the head in a curved manner,
partially erecting the occipital feathers, and emitting a note resembling
the sound produced by a person blowing through a tube. At the approach
of spring the males are observed repeating this action every now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
and then, while near the females, none of which seem to pay the least attention
to their civilities.
</p>

<p>
Whilst in ponds, they feed by diving and dabbling with their bills in
the mud amongst the roots of grasses, of which they eat the seeds also,
as well as snails and all kinds of aquatic insects. When on rivers, their
usual food consists of small fish and crays, the latter of which they procure
at the bottom. A male which I shot near Louisville, in the beginning
of May, exhibited a protuberance of the neck so very remarkable as
to induce me to cut the skin, when I found a frog, the body of which was
nearly two inches long, and which had almost choked the bird, as it allowed
me to go up within a dozen or fifteen paces before I took aim. This
species remains with us in the Western country later than most others of
its tribe, and not unfrequently as late as the Blue-winged Teal.
</p>

<p>
We are indebted for the discovery of this species to my friend the
Prince of Musignano, who first pointed out the difference between it and
the Tufted Duck of Europe. The distinctions that exist in the two species
he ascertained about the time of my first acquaintance with him at
Philadelphia in 1824, when he was much pleased on seeing my drawing
of a male and a female, which I had made at Louisville in Kentucky previous
to <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s visit to me there. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> supposed it identical with
the European species.
</p>

<p>
The summer haunts and habits of this Duck have not been ascertained;
for although Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> mentions that he found it not rare in the
fur countries, he says nothing of its eggs or nest. While with us it has
no long crest, but I am inclined to think that at the commencement of
the breeding season that appendage may be developed.

<h2>
THE SOOTY TERN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna fuliginosa</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXV. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Early in the afternoon of the 9th of May 1832, I was standing on
the deck of the United States’ revenue-cutter the Marion. The weather
was very beautiful, although hot, and a favourable breeze wafted us onwards
in our course. Captain <span class="smcap">Robert Day</span>, who stood near me, on
looking toward the south-west, ordered some person to be sent to the top
to watch the appearance of land. A young lad was instantly seen ascending
the rigging, and not many minutes after he had attained his post,
we heard from him the cry of “land.” It was the low keys of the Tortugas,
toward which we had been steering. No change was made in the
course of the “Lady of the Green Mantle,” who glided along as if aware of
the knowledge possessed by her commander. Now the light-house lantern
appeared, like a bright gem glittering in the rays of the sun. Presently
the masts and flags of several wreckers shewed us that they were anchored
in the small but safe harbour. We sailed on, and our active pilot,
who was also the first lieutenant of the Marion, pointed out to me a small
island which he said was at this season the resort of thousands of birds,
which he described by calling them “Black and White Sea Swallows,”
and again another islet, equally well stocked with another kind of Sea
Swallow, which he added were called Noddies, because they frequently
alighted on the yards of vessels at night, and slept there. He assured me
that both species were on their respective breeding-grounds by millions,
that the eggs of the first lay on the sand under bushes, at intervals of
about a foot, while the nests of the last were placed as thickly on the
bushes of their own chosen island. “Before we cast anchor,” he added,
“you will see them rise in swarms like those of bees when disturbed in
their hive, and their cries will deafen you.”
</p>

<p>
You may easily imagine how anxious I was to realize the picture; I
expressed a wish to be landed on the island; but the kind officer replied,
“My good Sir, you will soon be tired of their incessant noise and numbers,
and will enjoy the procuring of Boobies much better.” After various
tacks, we made our way through the curious and extremely dangerous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
channels leading to the small harbour, where we anchored. As the
chain grated the ear, I saw a cloud-like mass arise over the “Bird Key,”
from which we were only a few hundred yards distant; and in a few
minutes the yawl was carrying myself and my assistant ashore. On landing,
I felt for a moment as if the birds would raise me from the ground,
so thick were they all round, and so quick the motion of their wings.
Their cries were indeed deafening, yet not more than half of them took
to wing on our arrival, those which rose being chiefly male birds, as we
afterwards ascertained. We ran across the naked beach, and as we entered
the thick cover before us, and spread in different directions, we
might at every step have caught a sitting bird, or one scrambling through
the bushes to escape from us. Some of the sailors, who had more than
once been there before, had provided themselves with sticks, with which
they knocked down the birds as they flew thick around and over them.
In less than half an hour, more than a hundred Terns lay dead in a heap,
and a number of baskets were filled to the brim with eggs. We then returned
on board, and declined disturbing the rest any more that night.
My assistant, Mr <span class="smcap">H. Ward</span>, of London, skinned upwards of fifty specimens,
aided by Captain <span class="smcap">Day</span>’s servant. The sailors told me that the
birds were excellent eating, but on this point I cannot say much in corroboration
of their opinion, although I can safely recommend the eggs,
for I considered them delicious, in whatever way cooked, and during our
stay at the Tortugas we never passed a day without providing ourselves
with a good quantity of them.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span> told me that great numbers of the
Terns left their island at two o’clock, flew off towards the sea, and returned
a little before day, or about four o’clock. This I afterwards observed
to be regularly the case, unless there happened to blow a gale, a
proof that this species sees as well during the night as by day, when they
also go to sea in search of food for themselves and their young. In this
respect they differ from the <i>Sterna stolida</i>, which, when overtaken at sea
by darkness, even when land is only a few miles distant, alight on the
water, and frequently on the yards of vessels, where if undisturbed they
sleep until the return of day. It is from this circumstance that they have
obtained the name of Noddy, to which in fact they are much better entitled
than the present species, which has also been so named, but of
which I never observed any to alight on a vessel in which I was for
thirty-five days in the Gulf of Mexico, at a time when that bird was as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
abundant during the day as the other species, of which many were caught
at my desire by the sailors.
</p>

<p>
The present species rarely alights on the water, where it seems incommoded
by its long tail; but the other, the <i>Sterna stolida</i>, which, in
the shape of its tail, and in some of its habits, shews an affinity to the
Petrels, not only frequently alights on the sea, but swims about on floating
patches of the Gulf Weed, seizing on the small fry and little crabs
that are found among the branches of that plant, or immediately beneath
them.
</p>

<p>
I have often thought, since I became acquainted with the habits of
the bird which here occupies our attention, that it differs materially from
all the other species of the same genus that occur on our coasts. The
<i>Sterna fuliginosa</i> never dives headlong and perpendicularly as the smaller
species are wont to do, such as <i>St. Hirundo</i>, <i>St. arctica</i>, <i>St. minuta</i>, <i>St.
Dougallii</i>, or <i>St. nigra</i>, but passes over its prey in a curved line, and
picks it up. Its action I cannot better compare to that of any other bird
than the Night Hawk, while plunging over its female. I have often observed
this Tern follow and hover in the wake of a porpoise, while the
latter was pursuing its prey, and at the instant when by a sudden dash
it frightens and drives toward the surface the fry around it, the Tern as
suddenly passes over the spot, and picks up a small fish or two.
</p>

<p>
Nor is the flight of this Tern characterized by the buoyancy and undecidedness,
if I may so speak, of the other species mentioned above, it
being as firm and steady as that of the Cayenne Tern, excepting during
the movements performed in procuring its food. Like some of the smaller
gulls, this bird not unfrequently hovers close to the water to pick up
floating objects, such as small bits of fat pork and greasy substances
thrown overboard purposely for making the experiment. It is not improbable
that the habits peculiar to this species, the Noddy, and one or
two others, of which I shall have occasion to speak elsewhere, may tend
to induce systematic writers to place them in a new “subgenus.”
</p>

<p>
There is a circumstance connected with the habits of the two species
of which I now more particularly speak, which, although perhaps somewhat
out of place, I cannot refrain from introducing here. It is that the
<i>Sterna stolida always forms a nest on trees or bushes</i>, on which that bird
alights with as much ease as a Crow or Thrush; whereas the <i>Sterna fuliginosa</i>
never forms a nest of any sort, but deposits its eggs in a slight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
cavity which it scoops in the sand under the trees. But, reader, let us
return to the Bird Key.
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning I was put on shore, and remained there until
I had completed my observations on the Terns. I paid no attention to
their lamentable cries, which were the less piercing that on this occasion
I did not molest them in the least. Having seated myself on the shelly
sand, which here formed the only soil, I remained almost motionless for
several hours, in consequence of which the birds alighted about me, at
the distance of only a few yards, so that I could plainly see with what
efforts and pains the younger females deposited their eggs. Their bill
was open, and their pantings indicated their distress, but after the egg
had been expelled, they immediately walked off in an awkward manner,
until they reached a place where they could arise without striking the
branches of the bushes near them, when they flew away. Here and there,
in numerous places within twenty yards of me, females, having their complement
of eggs, alighted, and quietly commenced the labour of incubation.
Now and then a male bird also settled close by, and immediately
disgorged a small fish within the reach of the female. After some curious
reciprocal nods of their heads, which were doubtless intended as marks
of affection, the caterer would fly off. Several individuals, which had
not commenced laying their eggs, I saw scratch the sand with their feet,
in the manner of the common fowl, while searching for food. In the
course of this operation, they frequently seated themselves in the shallow
basin to try how it fitted their form, or find out what was still wanted to
ensure their comfort. Not the least semblance of a quarrel did I observe
between any two of these interesting creatures; indeed, they all appeared
as if happy members of a single family; and as if to gratify my utmost
wishes, a few of them went through the process of courtship in my presence.
The male birds frequently threw their heads over their back as it were, in
the manner of several species of gulls; they also swelled out their throats,
walked round the females, and ended by uttering a soft puffing sound as
they caressed them. Then the pair for a moment or two walked round
each other, and at length rose on wing and soon disappeared. Such is
one of the many sights it has been my good fortune to witness, and by
each of them have I been deeply impressed with a sense of the pervading
power of the Deity.
</p>

<p>
The Sooty Tern always lays three eggs as its full number, and in no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
instance, among thousands of the nests which were on the Bird Key, did
I find one more when the female was sitting close. I was desirous of ascertaining
whether the male and the female incubate alternately; but this
I was unable to do, as the birds frequently left their eggs for half an
hour or even three quarters at a time, but rarely longer. This circumstance,
together with the very slight difference in size and colour between
the sexes, was the cause of my failure.
</p>

<p>
It was curious to observe their actions whenever a large party landed
on the island. All those not engaged in incubation would immediately
rise in the air and scream aloud; those on the ground would then join them
as quickly as they could, and the whole forming a vast mass, with a broad
extended front, would as it were charge us, pass over for fifty yards or so,
then suddenly wheel round, and again renew their attack. This they would
repeat six or eight times in succession. When the sailors, at our desire,
all shouted as loud as they could, the phalanx would for an instant become
perfectly silent, as if to gather our meaning; but the next moment,
like a huge wave breaking on the beach, it would rush forward with
deafening noise.
</p>

<p>
When wounded and seized by the hand, this bird bites severely, and
utters a plaintive cry differing from its usual note, which is loud and
shrill, resembling the syllables <i>oo-ee, oo-ee</i>. Their nests are all scooped
near the roots or stems of the bushes, and under the shade of their boughs,
in many places within a few inches of each other. There is less difference
between their eggs, than is commonly seen in those of water birds, both
with respect to size and colouring. They generally measure two inches
and one-eighth, by one and a-half, have a smooth shell, with the ground
of a pale cream colour, sparingly marked with various tints of lightish
umber, and still lighter marks of purple, which appear as if within the
shell. The Lieutenant, <span class="smcap">N. Lacoste</span>, Esq. informed me that shortly after
the young are hatched, they ramble pell-mell over the island, to meet
their parents, and be fed by them; that these birds have been known to
collect there for the purpose of breeding, since the oldest wreckers on
that coast can recollect; and that they usually arrive in May, and remain
until the beginning of August, when they retire southward to spend
the winter months. I could not however obtain a sufficiently accurate
description of the different states of plumage which they go through, so
as to enable me to describe them in the manner I should wish to do. All
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
that I can say is, that before they take their departure, the young are
greyish-brown above, dull white beneath, and have the tail very short.
</p>

<p>
At Bird Key we found a party of Spanish Eggers from Havannah.
They had already laid in a cargo of about eight tons of the eggs of this
Tern and the Noddy. On asking them how many they supposed they
had, they answered that they never counted them, even while selling them,
but disposed of them at seventy-five cents per gallon; and that one turn
to market sometimes produced upwards of two hundred dollars, while it
took only a-week to sail backwards and forwards and collect their cargo.
Some eggers, who now and then come from Key West, sell their eggs at
twelve and a half cents the dozen; but wherever these eggs are carried,
they must soon be disposed of and eaten, for they become putrid in a few
weeks.
</p>

<p>
On referring to my journals once more, I find the following remarks
with reference to the Sooty Tern. It would appear that at some period
not very remote, the Noddy, <i>Sterna stolida</i>, must have had it in contemplation
to appropriate to itself its neighbour’s domains; as on examination
of this island, several thousand nests of that bird were found
built on the tops of the bushes, although no birds of the species were
about them. It is therefore probable that if such an attempt was made
by them, they were defeated and forced to confine themselves to the neighbouring
island, where they breed by themselves, although it is only a few
miles distant. That such interferences and conflicts now and then occur
among different species of birds, has often been observed by other persons,
and in several instances by myself, particularly among Herons. In
these cases, right or wrong, the stronger party never fails to dislodge the
weaker, and keep possession of the disputed ground.

<h2>
A WILD HORSE.
</h2>

<p>
While residing at Henderson in Kentucky, I became acquainted
with a gentleman who had just returned from the country in the neighbourhood
of the head waters of the Arkansas River, where he had purchased
a newly caught “Wild Horse,” a descendant of some of the horses
originally brought from Spain, and set at liberty in the vast prairies of
the Mexican lands. The animal was by no means handsome:—he had a
large head, with a considerable prominence in its frontal region, his thick
and unkemt mane hung along his neck to the breast, and his tail, too
scanty to be called flowing, almost reached the ground. But his chest
was broad, his legs clean and sinewy, and his eyes and nostrils indicated
spirit, vigour, and endurance. He had never been shod, and although he
had been ridden hard, and had performed a long journey, his black hoofs
had suffered no damage. His colour inclined to bay, the legs of a deeper
tint, and gradually darkening below until they became nearly black. I
inquired what might be the value of such an animal among the Osage
Indians, and was answered, that the horse being only four years old, he
had given for him, with the tree and the buffalo tug fastened to his head,
articles equivalent to about thirty-five dollars. The gentleman added,
that he had never mounted a better horse, and had very little doubt, that
if well fed, he could carry a man of ordinary weight from thirty-five to
forty miles a-day, for a month, as he had travelled at that rate upon him,
without giving him any other food than the grass of the prairies, or the
canes of the bottom lands, until he had crossed the Mississippi at Natchez,
when he fed him with corn. Having no farther use for him, now that he
had ended his journey, he said he was anxious to sell him, and thought he
might prove a good hunting horse for me, as his gaits were easy, and he
stood fire as well as any charger he had seen. Having some need of a
horse possessed of qualities similar to those represented as belonging to
the one in question, I asked if I might be allowed to try him. “Try
him, Sir, and welcome; nay, if you will agree to feed him and take care
of him, you may keep him for a month, if you choose.” So I had the
horse taken to the stable and fed.
</p>

<p>
About two hours afterwards, I took my gun, mounted the prairie
nag, and went to the woods. I was not long in finding him very sensible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
to the spur, and as I observed that he moved with great ease both to
himself and his rider, I thought of leaping over a log several feet in diameter,
to judge how far he might prove serviceable in deer-driving or
bear-hunting. So I gave him the reins, and pressed my legs to his belly
without using the spur, on which, as if aware that I wished to try his
mettle, he bounded off and cleared the log as lightly as an elk. I turned
him, and made him leap the same log several times, which he did with equal
ease, so that I was satisfied of his ability to clear any impediment in the
woods. I next determined to try his strength, for which purpose I took him
to a swamp, which I knew was muddy and tough. He entered it with his
nose close to the water, as if to judge of its depth, at which I was well
pleased, as he thus evinced due caution. I then rode through the swamp
in different directions, and found him prompt, decided, and unflinching.
Can he swim well? thought I;—for there are horses, which, although
excellent, cannot swim at all, but will now and then lie on their side, as
if contented to float with the current, when the rider must either swim
and drag them to the shore, or abandon them. To the Ohio then I went,
and rode into the water. He made off obliquely against the current, his
head well raised above the surface, his nostrils expanded, his breathing
free, and without any of the grunting noise emitted by many horses on
such occasions. I turned him down the stream, then directly against it,
and finding him quite to my mind, I returned to the shore, on reaching
which he stopped of his own accord, spread his legs, and almost shook
me off my seat. After this I put him to a gallop, and returning home
through the woods, shot from the saddle a turkey-cock, which he afterwards
approached as if he had been trained to the sport, and enabled me
to take it up without dismounting.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I reached the house of Dr <span class="smcap">Rankin</span>, where I then resided,
I sent word to the owner of the horse that I should be glad to see him.
When he came, I asked him what price he would take; he said, fifty dollars
in silver was the lowest. So I paid the money, took a bill of sale,
and became master of the horse. The Doctor, who was an excellent judge,
said smiling to me, “Mr <span class="smcap">Audubon</span>, when you are tired of him, I will refund
you the fifty dollars, for depend upon it he is a capital horse.” The
mane was trimmed, but the tail left untouched; the Doctor had him shod
“all round,” and for several weeks he was ridden by my wife, who was
highly pleased with him.
</p>

<p>
Business requiring that I should go to Philadelphia, Barro (he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
so named after his former owner) was put up for ten days and well attended
to. The time of my departure having arrived, I mounted him;
and set off at the rate of four miles an hour;—but here I must give you
the line of my journey, that you may, if you please, follow my course
on some such map as that of <span class="smcap">Tanner</span>’s. From Henderson through
Russellville, Nashville, and Knoxville, Abington in Virginia, the Natural
Bridge, Harrisonburgh, Winchester and Harper’s Ferry, Frederick and
Lancaster to Philadelphia. There I remained four days, after which I
returned by way of Pittsburgh, Wheeling, Zanesville, Chillicothe, Lexington,
and Louisville to Henderson. But the nature of my business
was such as to make me deviate considerably from the main roads, and I
computed the whole distance at nearly two thousand miles, the post roads
being rather more than sixteen hundred. I travelled not less than forty
miles a-day, and it was allowed by the Doctor that my horse was in as good
condition on my return as when I set out. Such a journey on a single
horse may seem somewhat marvellous in the eyes of a European; but in
those days almost every merchant had to perform the like, some from all
parts of the western country, even from St Louis on the Missouri, although
the travellers not unfrequently, on their return, sold their horses
at Baltimore, Philadelphia, or Pittsburgh, at which latter place they took
boat. My wife rode on a single horse from Henderson to Philadelphia,
travelling at the same rate. The country was then comparatively new;
few coaches travelled, and in fact the roads were scarcely fit for carriages.
About twenty days were considered necessary for performing a journey
on horseback from Louisville to Philadelphia, whereas now the same distance
may be travelled in six or seven days, or even sometimes less, this
depending on the height of the water in the Ohio.
</p>

<p>
It may be not uninteresting to you to know the treatment which the
horse received on those journeys. I rose every morning before day,
cleaned my horse, pressed his back with my hand, to see if it had been
galled, and placed on it a small blanket folded double, in such a manner
that when the latter was put on, half of the cloth was turned over it. The
surcingle, beneath which the saddle-bags were placed, confined the blanket
to the seat, and to the pad behind was fastened the great coat or
cloak, tightly rolled up. The bridle had a snaffle bit; a breastplate was
buckled in front to each skirt, to render the seat secure during an ascent;
but my horse required no crupper, his shoulders being high and well-formed.
On starting he trotted off at the rate of four miles an hour,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
which he continued. I usually travelled from fifteen to twenty miles before
breakfast, and after the first hour allowed my horse to drink as much
as he would. When I halted for breakfast, I generally stopped two
hours, cleaned the horse, and gave him as much corn blades as he could
eat. I then rode on until within half an hour of sunset, when I watered
him well, poured a bucket of cold water over his back, had his skin well
rubbed, his feet examined and cleaned. The rack was filled with blades,
the trough with corn, a good-sized pumpkin or some hens’ eggs, whenever
they could be procured, were thrown in, and if oats were to be had,
half a bushel of them was given in preference to corn, which is apt to
heat some horses. In the morning, the nearly empty trough and rack
afforded sufficient evidence of the state of his health.
</p>

<p>
I had not ridden him many days before he became so attached to me
that on coming to some limpid stream, in which I had a mind to bathe,
I could leave him at liberty to graze, and he would not drink if told not
to do so. He was ever sure-footed, and in such continual good spirits,
that now and then, when a turkey happened to rise from a dusting place
before me, the mere inclination of my body forward was enough to bring
him to a smart canter, which he would continue until the bird left the
road for the woods, when he never failed to resume his usual trot. On
my way homewards I met at the crossings of the Juniata River a gentleman
from New Orleans whose name is <span class="smcap">Vincent Nolte</span>. He was mounted
on a superb horse, for which he had paid three hundred dollars, and
a servant on horseback led another as a change. I was then an utter
stranger to him, and as I approached and praised his horse, he not
very courteously observed that he wished I had as good a one. Finding
that he was going to Bedford to spend the night, I asked him at what
hour he would get there. “Just soon enough to have some trouts ready
for our supper, provided you will join when you get there.” I almost
imagined that Barro understood our conversation; he pricked up his ears,
and lengthened his pace, on which Mr <span class="smcap">Nolte</span> caracolled his horse, and
then put him to a quick trot, but all in vain, for I reached the hotel
nearly a quarter of an hour before him, ordered the trouts, saw to the
putting away of my good horse, and stood at the door ready to welcome
my companion. From that day <span class="smcap">Vincent Nolte</span> has been a friend to
me. It was from him I received letters of introduction to the <span class="smcap">Rathbones</span>
of Liverpool, for which I shall ever be grateful to him. We rode together
as far as Shippingport, where my worthy friend <span class="smcap">Nicholas Berthoud</span>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
Esq. resided, and on parting with me he repeated what he had
many times said before, that he never had seen so serviceable a creature as
Barro.
</p>

<p>
If I recollect rightly, I gave a short verbal account of this journey,
and of the good qualities of my horse, to my learned friend <span class="smcap">J. Skinner</span>,
Esq. of Baltimore, who I believe has noticed them in his excellent Sporting
Magazine. We agreed that the importation of horses of this kind
from the Western Prairies might improve our breeds generally; and,
judging from those which I have seen, I am inclined to think that some
of them may prove fit for the course. A few days after reaching Henderson,
I parted with Barro, not without regret, for a hundred and twenty
dollars.

<h2>
THE NIGHT HERON.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea Nycticorax</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXVI. Adult Male and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Night Heron is a constant resident in the Southern States, where
it is found in abundance in the low swampy tracts near the coast, from
the mouth of Sabine River to the eastern boundaries of South Carolina.
On the whole of that vast extent of country, it may be procured at all
seasons. The adult birds keep farther south than the young, flocks of
the latter remaining in South Carolina during the whole winter, and there
the Night Herons are at that period more common than most other species
of the family. In that State it is named “the Indian Pullet,” in Lower
Louisiana the Creoles call it “<i>Gros-bec</i>,” the inhabitants of East Florida
know it under the name of “Indian Hen,” and in our Eastern States its
usual appellation is “Qua Bird.”
</p>

<p>
In the course of my winter rambles through East Florida, I met with
several of the large places of resort of Night Herons, and, in particular,
one remarkable for the vast number of birds congregated there. It is
about six miles below the plantation of my friend <span class="smcap">John Bullow</span>, Esq.,
on a bayou which opens into the Halifax River. There several hundred
pairs appeared to be already mated, although it was only the month of
January; many of the nests of former years were still standing, and all
appeared to live in peace and contentment. My friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>
is acquainted with a place on Ashley River, about four miles distant from
Charleston, where, among the branches of a cluster of live-oak trees, he
has for the last fifteen years found a flock of about fifty of these birds
during the winter. They were all young, not a single individual having
been observed in the adult plumage, which is the more remarkable,
because it is usual for young birds to retreat farther south during winter
than the old. It is very common at this period for the sportsmen near
Charleston to take their stand along the margins of the salt-water ponds,
to which the Herons generally resort about dusk; and they frequently
obtain several shots in an evening, but not a single old bird is known to
have been killed at this season.
</p>

<p>
The Night Heron seldom advances very far into the country, but remains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
on the low swampy lands along the coast. It is rare to see one
farther up the Mississippi than the mouth of the Arkansas, to which a few
are at times induced to go while rambling along the great stream. I
never saw one, or heard of any, whilst in Kentucky, and I doubt much
if they are ever seen in the upper parts of the State of Tennessee. The
distance of a hundred miles from the tide-mark appears to be the farthest
extent of their inland movements. On the other hand, they are fond of
resorting to the islands along the coast, on many of which they breed.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of spring, great numbers of those which have wintered
far south, leave their places of sojourn and migrate eastward, although
probably an equal number remain in the low lands of Louisiana and the
Floridas during the whole year. There, indeed, I have found them with
eggs in April and May, and as young birds just fledged were very abundant
at the same places, I concluded that these eggs were of the second
laying. By the middle of March, the number of Night Herons is
seen to increase daily in the Carolinas, and, about a month later, some
make their appearance in the Middle Districts, where many remain and
breed. They are not abundant in the State of New York, are seen sparingly
breeding in Massachusetts, while only a few proceed to Maine, and
farther eastward they are looked upon as a great curiosity. In Nova
Scotia, Newfoundland, and Labrador, this species is quite unknown.
</p>

<p>
Some European writers have alleged, that the Night Heron is scarce
in the United States, and of rare occurrence even in the southern parts.
I wish these people had been with me and my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span>, or with
some of the many hundred persons who reside in the Southern Districts,
or have travelled from Louisiana to North Carolina. How strange it
would have appeared to such assertors of notions, to have seen a boatload
of Night Herons shot in the course of a few hours, and that too in
the winter season.
</p>

<p>
Excepting while breeding, this species is extremely shy and wary, especially
the adults. To approach them from a distance after they have
seen you, is no easy task. They seem to know the distance at which
your gun can injure them, they watch all your movements, and at the
proper moment leave their perches. Should you chance to crack a stick
while advancing towards them, they start at once, give a few raps with
their wings in the manner of the Common Pigeon, and fly off as if delighted
at your disappointment. On the contrary, you may shoot them
with ease, if you lie in wait near the places to which they resort to roost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
by day, and at which they generally arrive singly, or a few at a time,
when, from your place of concealment among the trees, you may kill them
the moment they alight over your head, and at a short distance. In this
manner I have known forty or fifty procured by two sportsmen in the
course of about two hours. You may also not unfrequently shoot them
at any hour of the day, by starting them from secluded feeding-grounds,
and thus I have shot a good many in different parts of the United States,
and even in the Middle Districts. They are, however, rarely shot whilst
on the ground, their hearing being still more acute than that of the American
Bittern, which prefers squatting in the grass to flying off, when any
noise is heard, whereas the Night Heron rises immediately.
</p>

<p>
This species breeds in communities around the stagnant ponds, either
near rice plantations or in the interior of retired and secluded swamps, as
well as on some of the sea islands covered with evergreen trees. Their
heronries are formed either in low bushes, or in middle-sized or tall trees,
as seems most convenient or secure. In the Floridas, they are partial to
the mangroves that overhang the salt-water; in Louisiana, they prefer the
cypresses; and in the Middle States, they find the cedars most suitable.
In some breeding-places within a few miles of Charleston, which I visited
in company with my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, the nests were placed on low
bushes, and crowded together, some within a yard of the ground, others
raised seven or eight feet above it, many being placed flat on the branches,
while others were in the forks. Hundreds of them might be seen at once,
as they were built on the side of the bushes fronting the water. Those
which I found in the Floridas were all placed on the south-west sides of
mangrove islands, but were farther apart from each other, some being only
about a foot above high-water mark, while others were in the very tops
of the trees, which, however, scarcely exceeded twenty feet in height. In
some inland swamps in Louisiana, I saw them placed on the tops of tall
cypress trees about a hundred feet high, and along with those of <i>Ardea
Herodias</i>, <i>A. alba</i>, and some Anhingas. In the Jerseys I have found the
Night Herons breeding on water oaks and cedars; and my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas
Nuttall</span> informs me, that “in a very secluded and marshy island,
in Fresh Pond, near Boston, there likewise exists one of these ancient
heronries; and though the birds have been frequently robbed of their
eggs, in great numbers, by mischievous boys, they still lay again immediately
after, and usually succeed in raising a second brood.” The
same accurate observer remarks, that “about the middle of October, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
Qua Birds begin to retire from this part of Massachusetts, towards their
southern winter quarters, although a few of the young birds still linger
occasionally to the 29th or 30th of that month.” This last observation
is a farther evidence of the reluctance which the young of this species feel
to go as far south during winter as the old birds.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Night Heron is large, flattish, and formed of sticks
placed in different directions, sometimes to the height of three or four
inches. At times it is arranged with so little care, that the young upset
it before they are able to fly. Many of the nests are annually repaired,
and these birds, when they have once found an agreeable settlement, return
regularly to it, until some calamity forces them to abandon it. The
full number of the eggs is four, and they measure at an average two inches
and one-sixteenth by an inch and a half. They are thin-shelled, and of
a plain light sea-green colour. In about three weeks after the young are
hatched, most of them leave the nest, and crawl about the branches, to
which they cling firmly, ascending to the tops of the bushes or trees, and
there awaiting the return of their parents with food. If you approach
them at such times, the greatest consternation ensues both among the
young and the old birds; the loud and incessant croaking which both
have until then kept up, suddenly ceases; the parent birds rise in the air,
sail around and above you, some alighting on the neighbouring trees;
while the young scramble off in all directions to avoid being taken. So
great at times is their terror, that they throw themselves into the water,
and swim off with considerable rapidity, until they reach the shore, when
they run and hide in every convenient place. Retire for half an hour,
and you will be sure to hear the old and the young calling to each other;
the noise gradually increases, and in a short time is as loud as ever. The
stench emitted by the excrements with which the abandoned nests, the
branches and leaves of the trees and bushes, and the ground, are covered,
the dead young, the rotten and broken eggs, together with putrid
fish and other matters, renders a visit to these places far from pleasant.
Crows, Hawks and Vultures torment the birds by day, while Racoons
and other animals destroy them by night. The young are quite as good
for eating as those of the Common Pigeon, being tender, juicy, and fat,
with very little of the fishy taste of many birds which, like them, feed on
fishes and reptiles. At this period few if any of the old birds have the
long feathers of the hind head, and these are not reproduced before the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
latter part of the following winter, when they seem to attain their extreme
length in a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Night Heron is steady, rather slow, and often greatly
protracted. They propel themselves by regular flappings of the wings,
and, like the true Herons, draw in their head on the shoulders, while
their legs stretch out behind, and with the tail form a kind of rudder.
When alarmed they at times rise high in the air, and sail about for a
while. They sail in the same manner before alighting on their feeding
grounds, which they rarely do without having previously attended to
their security by alighting on the neighbouring trees and looking about
them. Their migrations are performed under night, when their passage
is indicated by their loud hoarse notes resembling the syllable <i>qua</i>, uttered
at pretty regular intervals. On these occasions they appear to fly faster
than usual.
</p>

<p>
On the ground, this bird exhibits none of the grace observed in all
the true Herons; it walks in a stooping posture, the neck much retracted,
until it sees its prey, when, with a sudden movement, it stretches it out
and secures its food. It is never seen standing motionless, waiting for its
prey, like the true Herons, but is constantly moving about in search of
it. Its feeding places are the sides of ditches, meadows, the shady banks
of creeks, bayous, and ponds or rivers, as well as the extensive salt-marshes
and mud-bars left exposed at low water; and I have observed it to alight
in the ponds in the suburbs of Charleston towards evening, and feed there.
In all such situations, excepting the last, this bird may often be seen by
day, but more especially in the evening or morning twilight, wading up
to its ankles, or, as we commonly say, its knee-joints. Its food consists of
fishes, shrimps, tadpoles, frogs, water-lizards, and leeches, small crustacea
of all kinds, water insects, moths, and even mice, which seem not less welcome
to it than its more ordinary articles of food. When satisfied,
it retires to some high tree on the banks of a stream or in the interior of
a swamp, and there it stands, usually on one leg, for hours at a time, apparently
dosing, though seldom sound asleep.
</p>

<p>
When wounded, this bird first tries to make its escape by hiding
among the grass or bushes, squatting the moment it finds what it deems
a secure place; but if no chance of a safe retreat occurs, it raises its
crest, ruffles its feathers, and, opening its bill, prepares to defend itself.
It can bite pretty severely, but the injury inflicted by its bill is not to
be compared with that produced by its claws, which on such occasions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
it uses with much effect. If you seize it, it utters a loud, rough, continued
sound, and tries to make its escape whenever it perceives the least
chance.
</p>

<p>
The Night Heron undergoes three annual changes of plumage ere it
attains its perfect state, although many individuals breed in the spring of
the third year. After the first autumnal moult, the young is as you see
it represented in the plate. In the second autumn, the markings of the
neck and other parts have almost entirely disappeared; the upper parts
of the head have become of a dull blackish-green, mixing near the upper
mandible with the dull brown of the first season, while the rest of the
plumage has assumed a uniform dull ochreous greyish-brown. In the
course of the following season, the bird exhibits the green of the shoulders
and back, the head is equally richly coloured, and the frontal band between
the upper mandible and the eye, and over the latter, is pure white.
At this age it rarely has the slender white feathers of the hind head longer
than an inch or two. The sides of the neck, and all the lower parts,
have become of a purer greyish-white. The wings are now spotless in
all their parts, and of a light brownish-grey, as is the tail. The following
spring, the plumage is complete, and the bird is as represented in the
plate. After this period, with the exception of losing its long crest-feathers
after the young are hatched, it retains its colouring. No difference
can be observed in the tints of the sexes, but the male is somewhat
larger.
</p>

<p>
A very considerable difference in size is observable at all seasons in
birds of this species. Some that are fully feathered, and therefore at least
three years old, measure as much as four inches less than others of the same
sex, and weigh less in proportion. These circumstances might suffice
with some naturalists to attempt to form two species out of one, but in
this they would certainly fail.
</p>

<p>
In the neighbourhood of New Orleans, and along the Mississippi, as
far up as Natchez, the shooting of this species is a favourite occupation
with the planters, who represent it as equalling any other bird in the delicacy
of its flesh.
</p>

<p>
The frog, of which I have introduced a figure, is common in the retired
swamps which the Night Heron frequents, and is often devoured
by it. The flowering plants which you see, are abundant in the States
of Georgia and South Carolina, as well as in the Floridas.

This species, which grows in swamps, and moist woods, in Virginia
and Carolina, is characterized by having an acute bifid spatha, an erect
funnel-shaped corolla of a pale rose-colour or pure white, with a short
tube at the base, the segments nearly equal, as are the declinate stamens.
It flowers in June and July, and attains a height of from eight inches to
a foot.

<h2>
THE HUDSONIAN CURLEW.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Numenius hudsonicus</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXVII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
The habits of this species, which until a few years ago was always
confounded with the Esquimaux Curlew, <i>Numenius borealis</i>, are yet in a
great measure unknown. Every person who writes on American birds
repeats, that it arrives at Hudson’s Bay, breeds farther north, &amp;c.; but
none has yet given any of those details so necessary to enable the student
of nature to judge in what respects this species resembles, or differs
from others, at the season of reproduction. During my visit to Labrador,
I made diligent inquiry respecting it and the Esquimaux Curlew,
but I obtained no information farther than that the latter is extremely
abundant for a few weeks in early autumn, and that the present species
was entirely unknown. Even Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span> and his sons, who had probably
killed thousands of the species just mentioned, had never seen it in the
course of their long residence at Bras d’Or. Nor is our information respecting
their winter retreats much better, for scarcely any of them are
ever seen in the colder months within the limits of the United States, and
their movements during their migrations are more rapid than those of
most water birds. In short, I am unable to present you with such an account
of them as I could have wished.
</p>

<p>
I have found this species abundant on the shores of New Jersey in
the month of May, and there they remain a few weeks. I once saw a
large flock of them near Charleston, in the month of December, and I
have found them in the Boston market in September. None were ever seen
by me in any part of the interior, where, indeed, it is probable they very
seldom make their appearance. As I have nothing of any importance to
add, I shall present you with a few extracts, from <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> and <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>,
both of whom have had opportunities of observing this species.
</p>

<p>
“The Short-billed Curlew,” says the former, “arrives in large flocks
on the sea-coast of New Jersey early in May, from the south, frequents
the salt-marshes, muddy shores, and inlets, feeding on small worms and
minute shell-fish. They are most commonly seen on mud-flats at low
water, in company with various other waders; and at high water roam
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
along the marshes. They fly high, and with great rapidity. A few are
seen in June, and as late as the beginning of July, when they generally
move off toward the north. Their appearance on these occasions is very
interesting: they collect together from the marshes as if by premeditated
design, rise to a great height in the air, usually an hour before sunset,
and, forming in one vast line, keep up a constant whistling on their way
to the north, as if conversing with one another to render the journey more
agreeable. Their flight is then more slow and regular, that the feeblest
may keep up with the line of march; while the glittering of their beautifully
speckled wings, sparkling in the sun, produces altogether a very
pleasing spectacle.
</p>

<p>
“In the month of June, while the dewberries are ripe, these birds
sometimes frequent the fields, in company with the Long-billed Curlews,
where brambles abound; soon get very fat, and are at that time excellent
eating.”
</p>

<p>
Nuttall says, “From the middle of August to the beginning of September,
they arrive in the vicinity of Massachusetts Bay, and other parts
of New England, frequenting the pastures as well as marshes, and fatten
on grasshoppers and berries, till the time of their departure, about the
close of September; and they wholly disappear from New Jersey, on their
way to the south, early in the month of November.”
</p>

<p>
I have only to add, that, having compared specimens of the present
species with the Whimbrel of Europe, <i>Numenius Phæopus</i>, I am satisfied
that they are perfectly distinct.

<h2>
THE GREAT MARBLED GODWIT.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Limosa Fedoa</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXVIII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
This fine bird is found during winter on all the large muddy flats of
the coast of Florida that are intermixed with beds of racoon oysters. As
the tide rises it approaches the shores, and betakes itself to the wet savannahs.
At this season it is generally seen in flocks of five or six, searching
for food in company with the Tell-tale, the Yellow-shanks, the Long-billed
Curlew, and the White Ibis. While feeding, it probes the mud and wet
sand, often plunging its bill to its whole length, in the manner of the
Common Snipe and the Woodcock. It is fond of the small crabs called fiddlers,
many of which it obtains both by probing their burrows, and running
after them along the edges of the salt meadows and marshes. Sometimes
you see it wading in the water up to its body, and when about to
lose ground, it rises and extends its wings, still continuing to search for
fry, until forced to fly off by the increased depth of the water, when it
alights on the shore and recommences its operations. While feeding on
the banks, it appears to search for food between and under the oysters with
singular care, at times pushing the bill sidewise into the soft mud beneath
the shells. Towards the middle of the day, the separate flocks come together,
assembling on some large sand-bar, where they remain for hours,
trimming their plumage, after which many of them continue some time
motionless, standing on one leg. Suddenly, however, they are all seen to
stretch their wings upwards, their bleating notes are heard, and the next
moment the flock rises, and disperses in small parties, each of which proceeds
in a different direction in search of food.
</p>

<p>
Few birds are more shy or vigilant than the Great Marbled Godwit.
It watches the movements of the gunner with extreme care, particularly
while in small flocks, in which case it rarely happens that one can approach
them, and they are more commonly shot by coming unawares over
the concealed sportsman. When in large flocks I have known them to
be neared, and killed in great numbers. On such occasions, they walk
towards each other, until they are quite close, when they stand still. Then
is the time for the gunner, who has driven them before him as it were, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
the extremity of a mud or sand-bar, to fire with a certainty of obtaining
something worth his trouble, for besides the number killed by his first
shot, he is likely to commit equal havock with the second, as they fly off
in a dense mass.
</p>

<p>
On the 31st of May 1832, I saw an immense number of these birds
on an extensive mud-bar bordering one of the Keys of Florida, about six
miles south of Cape Sable. When I landed with my party, the whole,
amounting to some thousands, collected in the manner mentioned above.
Four or five guns were fired at once, and the slaughter was such, that I
was quite satisfied with the number obtained, both for specimens and for
food. For this reason, we refrained from firing at them again, although
the temptation was at times great, as they flew over and wheeled round
us for a while, until at length they alighted at some distance and began
to feed. Those which we killed were plump, and afforded excellent eating.
I was much surprised to find these Godwits so far south, but next
morning, when none were to be seen excepting some wounded birds which
we had not pursued, I concluded that the flock, which was the largest I
have seen, had merely alighted there for the day.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird is regular and rather quick, although in the
latter respect not to be compared with that of the Curlews. When flying
to a considerable distance, or migrating, they usually proceed in extended
lines, presenting an irregular front, which rarely preserves its continuity
for any length of time, but undulates and breaks as the birds advance.
The beat of their wings is regular, and they rarely utter any cries on such
occasions.
</p>

<p>
This species enters the United States, on its return from its northern
breeding-grounds, about the middle of August, and probably travels along
the coast at that period as well as when proceeding northward, none having
been seen by me or my party in Labrador or Newfoundland, and
their passage having been observed only on the Atlantic shores of Nova
Scotia, and the whole line of our coast, on different parts of which some
of the flocks alight, and rest for a few weeks, both in spring and in autumn.
I may add, that I never saw one of these birds beyond the distance
of a few miles from the sea-shore.

<h2>
THE AMERICAN COOT.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fulica americana</i></span>, <span class="smcap">Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXXXIX. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
From November until the middle of April, the Coots are extremely
numerous in the southern parts of the Floridas, and the lower portions
of Louisiana. At that season they are seen in flocks of several hundreds,
following their avocations on all the secluded bayous, grassy lakes,
and inlets, which are so plentiful in those countries; but after the period
above mentioned none remain, and therefore it is certain none can breed
there, although such is asserted by Mr <span class="smcap">Bartram</span>, who no doubt mistook
the Common Gallinule for the Coot, that bird breeding in those places in
considerable numbers. During the month of September, the Coot is
also abundant on all the western waters, and its appearance in those districts
being so much earlier than in the Floridas, is a sure indication of
the inland course of its migrations. On the sea coast, in fact, it is comparatively
rare.
</p>

<p>
Although the curious form of their feet, and the situation of their
legs, might induce one to suppose these birds incapable of moving on land
with ease, experience proves the contrary, for they not only walk with
freedom, but can run with great speed when necessary. They are accustomed
to leave the water too, and resort to open lands on the margins
of streams and lakes, for the purpose of feeding, both in the morning and
in the evening. While ascending the Mississippi, being about fifty miles
above New Orleans, on the 21st of March 1822, the weather cloudy, I
had the pleasure of seeing about six or seven hundreds of these birds
feeding on the grass of a savannah bordering the river. I took them while
at some distance, for a great flock of Guinea Fowls. Their movements
were brisk, they often struck at each other in the manner of the domestic
fowl, and ran with surprising celerity. As I approached nearer, I plainly
saw them nibble the tender grass, in the same manner as poultry; and
having found a place of concealment behind a rise of the ground, I laid
myself flat, and observed their motions at leisure; but during twenty minutes
spent in that situation, I did not hear a single note from the flock.
I fired among them, and killed five, on which the rest, after running a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
few steps, all rose and flew off with speed towards the river, mounted high
in the air, came curving over me, their legs hanging behind, their wings
producing a constant whir, and at length alighted on a narrow channel
between the shore, where I was, and a small island. Following them
with caution, I got sufficiently near to some of them to be able to see them
leap from the water to seize the young leaves of the willows that overhung
the shores. While swimming, they moved with ease, although not with
much speed, and used a constantly repeated movement of the head and
neck, corresponding with that of the feet. Now, twenty or thirty of them
would close their ranks, and swim up the stream in a lengthened body,
when they would disperse, and pick up the floating substances, not one of
them diving all the time. On firing at a large group of them that had approached
me, they started off in various directions, patting the water with
their feet, and rushing with extended wings, for thirty or forty yards,
but without actually flying. After this, they made towards the brushy
shores, and disappeared for about a quarter of an hour. The rest of the
birds, which were a few hundred yards off, scarcely took notice of the report
of the gun; and before I left the place, they had returned to the
shore, and walked into another savannah, where they probably remained
until night. The next morning not a single Coot could I find while looking
for them, for several miles along the river, and I concluded that they
had left the place, and continued their migratory journey northward, this
being about the beginning of the time of their general departure.
</p>

<p>
Whilst at General <span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s, in East Florida, I found the Coot
abundant in every ditch, bayou, or pond. This was in December 1831,
and in the next month I saw great flocks of them near the plantation of
my friend <span class="smcap">John Bullow</span>, Esq. Whilst on a visit to Spring Garden
springs, at the head of the St John’s River, I observed them to be equally
abundant along the grassy margins of the lagoons and lakes. On my return
from the upper parts of that river to St Augustine, on the 28th
February, I saw large flocks of them already moving northward. They
had suddenly become shy, and would rise before our boat, at a distance
of a hundred yards or so, with apparently scarcely any difficulty, and fly
in loose flocks at a considerable height, half a mile or more at a time,
and without uttering a note. Indeed, the only sound I ever heard these
birds utter, is a rough guttural note, somewhat resembling <i>cruck, cruck</i>,
which they use when alarmed, or when chasing each other on the water in
anger. I am doubtful whether our Coot cackles and cries by night and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
by day, as has been reported; on the other hand, I am pretty well assured
that Gallinules and Rails of different species have been confounded with
the Coot in this respect.
</p>

<p>
I never saw this species dive for food, and the only fish that I ever
found in the many that I have opened, was very small minnows or fry,
which I think they catch along the shallow edges of the water. Indeed,
unless when wounded, our Coot feels great reluctance at immersing its
body in the water; at all events, it has not the quickness of any of the
diving birds, and rarely escapes the shot of a common flint gun while attempting
to get away. When wounded it dives to some distance, but as
soon as it reaches the grass or reeds, it contents itself with lying flat on
the water, and thus swimming to the nearest shore, on reaching which it at
once runs off and hides in the first convenient place. When undisturbed,
it feeds both by day and by night, and as often on land as on the water.
Its food consists of seeds, grasses, small fishes, worms, snails, and insects,
and along with these it introduces into its stomach a good quantity of
rather coarse sand.
</p>

<p>
The principal breeding places of this species are yet unknown to me.
At Charleston it was supposed that it breeds in the neighbourhood of
that city; but my friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> while searching for their nests at the
proper season, saw that the Common Gallinule was in fact the bird that
had been taken for the Coot. My learned friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> mentions that
a pair had bred in Fresh Pond near Boston, and that he there saw parents
and young. Some travelling lumberers assured me that the Coot breeds
in numbers in the lakes lying between Mars Hill in Maine and the St
Lawrence River; but I can find no authentic accounts of its nest having
been found in any part of the United States, although some probably
breed on the borders of our northern lakes.
</p>

<p>
In Louisiana, this species is named <i>Poule d’Eau</i>, which is also applied
to <i>Rallus crepitans</i>. In all other parts of the Union, it is known by the
names of Mud Hen and Coot. The appellation of “Flusterers” given to
it by Mr <span class="smcap">Lawson</span> in his History of South Carolina, never came to my
ear, during my visits to that State.
</p>

<p>
These birds are frequently caught in the nets placed across the bayous
of the lakes in the neighbourhood of New Orleans, for the purpose of
catching Blue-winged Teals and other Ducks. They come against them
while flying, but if the hunter is not extremely quick they make their
escape by nimbly scrambling up, using their bill and feet until they reach
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
the outer part of the net, when they drop into the water like so many
terapins. At times they congregate in vast numbers, and swim so closely
that a hunter in my employ, while on Lake Barataria, killed eighty at a
single shot. They are extremely abundant in the New Orleans’ markets
during the latter part of autumn and in winter, when the negroes and the
poorer classes purchase them to make “gombo.” In preparing them for
cooking, they skin them like rabbits instead of plucking them.
</p>

<p>
Both old and young birds differ considerably in size and weight. The
male, from which I drew the figure in the plate, was procured at General
<span class="smcap">Hernandez</span>’s, in East Florida, and was among the best of about thirty
shot on one of my excursions there.

<h2>
THE ROSEATE TERN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna Dougallii</i>, Mont.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXL. Adult.</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 28th of April 1832, it was my lot to be on the beautiful rocky
islet named Indian Key, where I spent a few hours of the night in unsuccessful
attempts to procure repose, which was effectually banished by
the consciousness of my being in a portion of the country not yet examined
by any industrious student of nature, and in which I expected to
find much that would prove interesting. The rain fell in torrents, and
the rattling of the large drops on the shingles of the veranda in which my
hammock had been slung, together with the chillness of the air, contributed
to keep me awake. Finding it useless to remain in bed, I roused
my companions; it was just four o’clock, and in a few minutes all the
people in the house were up, and breakfast preparing. Before six the
rain abated, and as I was determined not to lose a day, the guns were
mustered, we made our way to the boats, and pushed off through a gentle
shower in quest of unknown birds! In about an hour the rain ceased, the
sky gradually cleared, and the sun soon dried our clothes. About this
time we observed a great number of Terns on a sand bar, which we approached.
The birds were not shy, so that we obtained an opportunity
of firing two guns at them, when we leaped out, and on wading to the
shore picked up thirty-eight Roseate Terns and several of another species.
</p>

<p>
Beautiful, indeed, are Terns of every kind, but the Roseate excels the
rest, if not in form, yet in the lovely hue of its breast. I had never seen
a bird of this species before, and as the unscathed hundreds arose and
danced as it were in the air, I thought them the Humming Birds of the
sea, so light and graceful were their movements. Now they flocked together
and hovered over us, again with a sudden dash they plunged towards
us in anger; even their cries of wrath sounded musical, and although
I had carried destruction among them, I felt delighted. As I
have just said, I had not before seen a Roseate Tern, not even the skin
of one stuffed with tow; the species was not in the Synopsis of my friend
<span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>, and now I had my cap filled to the brim with specimens.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
You may rest assured that I took precious care of those which I had procured,
but not another individual was robbed of life on that excursion.
The other Terns were as new to me. I observed the form of their black
bill and feet, the yellow tip of the former, and wrapped them up with
care, while I tried to recollect the name they bore in books. To have
found hundreds of the Roseate Tern in the Floridas, while I had anxious
but slender hopes of meeting it on the coast of Labrador, was to me
quite astonishing. So it was, however, and I determined to ransack every
key and sand-beach, to try to find its breeding-ground. Nor were my
desires ungratified.
</p>

<p>
The Roseate Tern spends the breeding season along the southern
shores of the Floridas in considerable numbers. At different times in the
course of nearly three months which I spent among the keys, I saw flocks
of twenty, thirty, or more pairs, breeding on small detached rocky islands,
scantily furnished with grass, and in the company of hundreds of Sandwich
Terns. The two species appeared to agree well together, and their
nests were intermingled. The full number of eggs of the present species
is three. They differ considerably in size and markings; their average
length, however, is an inch and three quarters, their breadth an inch and
one-eighth; they are of a longish oval shape, rather narrowed at the
small end, of a dull buff or clay colour, sparingly sprinkled and spotted
with different tints of umber and light purple. They were deposited on
the bare rocks, among the roots of the grasses, and left in fair weather to
the heat of the sun. Like those of the Common Tern and other species,
they are delicious eating. The eggs of the Sandwich Tern were more
attended to during the day, but toward night both species sat on their
eggs. I did not see any of the young, but procured a good number of
those of the preceding year, which kept apart from the old birds, but had
in all respects the same habits.
</p>

<p>
The Roseate Tern is at all times a noisy, restless bird; and on approaching
its breeding place, it incessantly emits its sharp shrill cries, resembling
the syllable <i>crāk</i>. Its flight is unsteady and flickering, like that
of the Arctic or Lesser Terns, but rather more buoyant and graceful.
They would dash at us and be off again with astonishing quickness,
making great use of their tail on such occasions. While in search of prey,
they carry the bill in the manner of the Common Tern, that is perpendicularly
downward, plunge like a shot, with wings nearly closed, so as
to immerse part of the body, and immediately reascend. They were seen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
dipping in this manner eight or ten times in succession, and each time
generally secured a small fish. Their food consisted of fishes, and a kind
of small molluscous animal which floats near the surface, and bears the
name of “sailor’s button.” They usually kept in parties of from ten to
twenty, followed the shores of the sand-bars and keys, moving backwards
and forwards much in the manner of the Lesser Tern, and wherever a
shoal of small fish was found, there they would hover and dash headlong
at them for several minutes at a time.
</p>

<p>
The wreckers informed me that this species returns regularly to these
islands each spring, about the 10th of April, and goes off southward early
in September. These birds, with their favourite companions the Sandwich
Terns, habitually resorted to the sand-bars each day, to rest for an
hour or two. I have never seen them on any part of our middle or eastern
coast, and am of opinion that they rarely proceed farther eastward than
the Capes of Florida, and that they are more attached to the immediate
vicinity of the shores than the larger species, which more generally fly
out to some distance. The delicate and beautiful rosy tint of the breast
soon fades after death. Those specimens which were not skinned immediately
after being procured did not retain it for a week, and in none of
them was it perceptible, without separating the feathers, at the end of a
month. In winter it disappears, as well as the glossy black of the head.
The length of the outer tail-feathers varies considerably; but I could perceive
no decided difference of size or colour in the sexes, although I thought
the females somewhat smaller than the males.

<h2>
REMINISCENCES OF THOMAS BEWICK.
</h2>

<p>
Through the kindness of Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span> of Twizel-House in Northumberland,
I had anticipated the pleasure of forming an acquaintance with
the celebrated and estimable <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>, whose works indicate an era in the
history of the art of engraving on wood. In my progress southward,
after leaving Edinburgh in 1827, I reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne about
the middle of April, when Nature had begun to decorate anew the rich
country around. The lark was in full song, the blackbird rioted in the
exuberance of joy, the husbandman cheerily plied his healthful labours,
and I, although a stranger in a foreign land, felt delighted with all around
me, for I had formed friends who were courteous and kind, and whose
favour I had reason to hope would continue. Nor have I been disappointed
in my expectations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Bewick</span> must have heard of my arrival at Newcastle before I had an
opportunity of calling upon him, for he sent me by his son the following
note:—“T. <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>’s compliments to Mr <span class="smcap">Audubon</span>, and will be glad of
the honour of his company this day to tea at six o’clock.” These few
words at once proved to me the kindness of his nature, and, as my labours
were closed for the day, I accompanied the son to his father’s house.
</p>

<p>
As yet I had seen but little of the town, and had never crossed the
Tyne. The first remarkable object that attracted my notice was a fine
church, which my companion informed me was that of St Nicholas. Passing
over the river by a stone bridge of several arches, I saw by the wharfs
a considerable number of vessels, among which I distinguished some of
American construction. The shores on either side were pleasant, the
undulated ground being ornamented with buildings, windmills, and glassworks.
On the water glided, or were swept along by great oars, boats
of singular form, deeply laden with the subterranean produce of the hills
around.
</p>

<p>
At length we reached the dwelling of the Engraver, and I was at once
shewn to his workshop. There I met the old man, who, coming towards
me, welcomed me with a hearty shake of the hand, and for a moment took
off a cotton night-cap, somewhat soiled by the smoke of the place. He
was a tall stout man, with a large head, and with eyes placed farther apart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
than those of any man that I have ever seen:—a perfect old Englishman,
full of life, although seventy-four years of age, active and prompt in his
labours. Presently he proposed shewing me the work he was at, and went
on with his tools. It was a small vignette, cut on a block of boxwood not
more than three by two inches in surface, and represented a dog frightened
at night by what he fancied to be living objects, but which were actually
roots and branches of trees, rocks, and other objects bearing the semblance
of men. This curious piece of art, like all his works, was exquisite,
and more than once did I feel strongly tempted to ask a rejected bit, but
was prevented by his inviting me up stairs, where, he said, I should soon
meet all the best artists of Newcastle.
</p>

<p>
There I was introduced to the Misses <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>, amiable and affable
ladies, who manifested all anxiety to render my visit agreeable. Among
the visitors I saw a Mr <span class="smcap">Goud</span>, and was highly pleased with one of the
productions of his pencil, a full length miniature in oil of <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>, well
drawn, and highly finished.
</p>

<p>
The old gentleman and I stuck to each other, he talking of my drawings,
I of his wood-cuts. Now and then he would take off his cap, and
draw up his grey worsted stockings to his nether clothes; but whenever
our conversation became animated, the replaced cap was left sticking as
if by magic to the hind part of his head, the neglected hose resumed
their downward tendency, his fine eyes sparkled, and he delivered his sentiments
with a freedom and vivacity which afforded me great pleasure.
He said he had heard that my drawings had been exhibited in Liverpool,
and felt great anxiety to see some of them, which he proposed to gratify
by visiting me early next morning along with his daughters and a few
friends. Recollecting at that moment how desirous my sons, then in
Kentucky, were to have a copy of his works on Quadrupeds, I asked him
where I could procure one, when he immediately answered “Here,” and
forthwith presented me with a beautiful set.
</p>

<p>
The tea-drinking having in due time come to an end, young <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>,
to amuse me, brought a bagpipe of a new construction, called the Durham
Pipe, and played some simple Scotch, English and Irish airs, all
sweet and pleasing to my taste. I could scarcely understand how, with
his large fingers, he managed to cover each hole separately. The instrument
sounded somewhat like a hautboy, and had none of the shrill warlike
notes or booming sound of the military bagpipe of the Scotch Highlanders.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
The company dispersed at any early hour, and when I parted
from <span class="smcap">Bewick</span> that night, I parted from a friend.
</p>

<p>
A few days after this I received another note from him, which I read
hastily, having with me at the moment many persons examining my drawings.
This note having, as I understood it, intimated his desire that I
should go and dine with him that day, I accordingly went; but judge of
my surprise when, on arriving at his house at 5 o’clock, with an appetite
becoming the occasion, I discovered that I had been invited to tea and
not to dinner. However, the mistake was speedily cleared up to the satisfaction
of all parties, and an abundant supply of eatables was placed on
the table. The Reverend <span class="smcap">William Turner</span> joined us, and the evening
passed delightfully. At first our conversation was desultory and multifarious,
but when the table was removed, <span class="smcap">Bewick</span> took his seat by the
fire, and we talked of our more immediate concerns. In due time we
took leave, and returned to our homes, pleased with each other and with
our host.
</p>

<p>
Having been invited the previous evening to breakfast with <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>
at 8, I revisited him at that hour on the 16th April, and found the whole
family so kind and attentive that I felt quite at home. The good gentleman,
after breakfast, soon betook himself to his labours, and began to
shew me, as he laughingly said, how easy it was to cut wood; but I soon
saw that cutting wood in his style and manner was no joke, although to
him it seemed indeed easy. His delicate and beautiful tools were all
made by himself, and I may with truth say that his shop was the only
artist’s “shop” that I ever found perfectly clean and tidy. In the course
of the day <span class="smcap">Bewick</span> called upon me again, and put down his name on my
list of subscribers in behalf of the Literary and Philosophical Society of
Newcastle. In this, however, his enthusiasm had misled him, for the
learned body for which he took upon himself to act, did not think proper
to ratify the compact.
</p>

<p>
Another invitation having come to me from Gatehead, I found my
good friend seated in his usual place. His countenance seemed to me to
beam with pleasure as he shook my hand. “I could not bear the idea,”
said he, “of your going off, without telling you, in written words, what
I think of your Birds of America. Here it is in black and white, and
make of it what use you may, if it be of use at all.” I put the unsealed
letter in my pocket, and we chatted on subjects connected with natural
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
history. Now and then he would start and exclaim, “Oh, that I were
young again! I would go to America too. Hey! what a country it will
be, Mr <span class="smcap">Audubon</span>.” I retorted by exclaiming, “Hey! what a country it
is already, Mr <span class="smcap">Bewick</span>!” In the midst of our conversation on birds and
other animals, he drank my health and the peace of all the world in hot
brandy toddy, and I returned the compliment, wishing, no doubt in accordance
with his own sentiments, the health of all our enemies. His
daughters enjoyed the scene, and remarked, that for years, their father
had not been in such a flow of spirits.
</p>

<p>
I regret that I have not by me at present the letter which this generous
and worthy man gave me that evening, otherwise, for his sake, I
should have presented you with it. It is in careful keeping, however, as a
memorial of a man whose memory is dear to me; and be assured I regard
it with quite as much pleasure as a manuscript “Synopsis of the Birds
of America,” by <span class="smcap">Alexander Wilson</span>, which that celebrated individual
gave to me at Louisville in Kentucky, more than twenty years ago.
<span class="smcap">Bewick</span>’s letter, however, will be presented to you along with many others,
in connection with some strange facts, which I hope may be useful to the
world. We protracted our conversation beyond our usual time of retiring
to rest, and at his earnest request, and much to my satisfaction, I
promised to spend the next evening with him, as it was to be my last at
Newcastle for some time.
</p>

<p>
On the 19th of the same month I paid him my last visit, at his house.
When we parted, he repeated three times, “God preserve you, God bless
you!” He must have been sensible of the emotion which I felt, and
which he must have read in my looks, although I refrained from speaking
on the occasion.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks previous to the death of this fervent admirer of nature,
he and his daughters paid me a visit in London. He looked as well as
when I had seen him at Newcastle. Our interview was short but agreeable,
and when he bade adieu, I was certainly far from thinking that it
might be the last. But so it was, for only a very short time had elapsed
when I saw his death announced in the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
My opinion of this remarkable man is, that he was purely a son of
nature, to whom alone he owed nearly all that characterized him as an
artist and a man. Warm in his affections, of deep feeling, and possessed
of a vigorous imagination, with correct and penetrating observation, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
needed little extraneous aid to make him what he became, the first engraver
on wood that England has produced. Look at his tail-pieces,
Reader, and say if you ever saw so much life represented before, from the
glutton who precedes the Great Black-backed Gull, to the youngsters flying
their kite, the disappointed sportsman who, by shooting a magpie, has
lost a woodcock, the horse endeavouring to reach the water, the bull roaring
near the style, or the poor beggar attacked by the rich man’s mastiff.
As you turn each successive leaf, from beginning to end of his admirable
books, scenes calculated to excite your admiration everywhere present
themselves. Assuredly you will agree with me in thinking that in his
peculiar path none has equalled him. There may be men now, or some
may in after years appear, whose works may in some respects rival or even
excel his, but not the less must <span class="smcap">Thomas Bewick</span> of Newcastle-on-Tyne
be considered in the art of engraving on wood what <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> will ever be
in natural history, though not the founder, yet the enlightened improver
and illustrious promoter.

<p>
High in the thin keen air, far above the rugged crags of the desolate
shores of Labrador, proudly sails the tyrant Gull, floating along on almost
motionless wing, like an eagle in his calm and majestic flight. On widely
extended pinions, he moves in large circles, constantly eyeing the objects
below. Harsh and loud are his cries, and with no pleasant feeling do
they come on the winged multitudes below. Now onward he sweeps,
passes over each rocky bay, visits the little islands, and shoots off towards
the mossy heaths, attracted perhaps by the notes of the Grous or some
other birds. As he flies over each estuary, lake, or pool, the breeding
birds prepare to defend their unfledged broods, or ensure their escape
from the powerful beak of their remorseless spoiler. Even the shoals of
the finny tribes sink deeper into the waters as he approaches; the young
birds become silent in their nests or seek for safety in the clefts of the
rocks; the Guillemots and Gannets dread to look up, and the other Gulls,
unable to cope with the destroyer, give way as he advances. Far off
among the rolling billows, he spies the carcass of some monster of the deep,
and, on steady wing, glides off towards it. Alighting on the huge whale,
he throws upwards his head, opens his bill, and, louder and fiercer than
ever, sends his cries through the air. Leisurely he walks over the putrid
mass, and now, assured that all is safe, he tears, tugs, and swallows piece
after piece, until he is crammed to the throat, when he lays himself down
surfeited and exhausted, to rest for a while in the feeble sheen of the northern
sun. Great, however, are the powers of his stomach, and ere long the
half-putrid food which vulture-like he has devoured, is digested. Like all
gluttons, he loves variety, and away he flies to some well-known isle, where
thousands of young birds or eggs are to be found. There, without remorse,
he breaks the shells, swallows their contents, and begins leisurely
to devour the helpless young. Neither the cries of the parents, nor all
their attempts to drive the plunderer away, can induce him to desist until
he has again satisfied his ever-craving appetite. But although tyrannical,
the Great Gull is a coward, and meanly does he sneak off when he sees
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
the Skua fly up, which, smaller as it is, yet evinces a thoughtless intrepidity,
that strikes the ravenous and merciless bird with terror.
</p>

<p>
If we compare this species with some other of its tribe, and mark its
great size, its powerful flight, and its robust constitution, we cannot but
wonder to find its range so limited during the breeding season. Few individuals
are to be found northward of the entrance into Baffin’s Bay,
and rarely are they met with beyond this, as no mention is made of them
by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> in the Fauna Boreali-Americana. Along our coast,
none breed farther south than the eastern extremity of Maine. The
western shores of Labrador, along an extent of about three hundred miles,
afford the stations to which this species resorts during spring and summer;
there it is abundant, and there it was that I studied its habits.
</p>

<p>
The farthest limits of the winter migrations of the young, so far as I
have observed, are the middle portions of the eastern coast of the Floridas.
While at St Augustine, in the winter of 1831, I saw several pairs keeping
company with the young Brown Pelican, more as a matter of interest
than of friendship, as they frequently chased them as if to force them to
disgorge a portion of their earnings, acting much in the same manner as
the Lestris does toward the smaller Gulls, but without any effect. They
were extremely shy, alighted only on the outer edges of the outer sand-bars,
and could not be approached, as they regularly walked off before my
party the moment any of us moved towards them, until reaching the last
projecting point, they flew off, and never stopped until out of sight. At
what period they left that coast I am unable to say. Some are seen scattered
along our sea-shores, from the Floridas to the Middle States, there
being but few old birds among them; but the species does not become
abundant until beyond the eastern extremities of the Connecticut and
Long Island, when their number greatly increases the farther you proceed.
On the whole of that extensive range, these birds are very shy and
wary, and those which are procured are merely “chance shots.” They
seldom advance far up the bays, unless forced to do so by severe weather
or heavy gales; and although I have seen this bird on our great lakes, I
do not remember having ever observed an individual on any of our eastern
rivers, at a distance from the sea, whereas the <i>Larus argentatus</i> is frequently
found in such places.
</p>

<p>
Towards the commencement of summer, these wandering birds are
seen abandoning the waters of the ocean to tarry for a while on the wild
shores of Labrador, dreary and desolate to man, but to them delightful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
as affording all that they can desire. One by one they arrive, the older
individuals first. As they view from afar the land of their birth, that
moment they emit their loud cries, with all the joy a traveller feels when
approaching his loved home. The males sooner or later fall in with the
females of their choice, and together they proceed to some secluded sand-bar,
where they fill the air with their furious laughs until the rocks echo
again. Should the student of nature happen to be a distant spectator of
these meetings, he too must have much enjoyment. Each male bows,
moves around his mate, and no doubt discloses to her the ardour of his
love. Matters are managed to the satisfaction of all parties, yet day after
day for a while, at the retreat of the waters, they meet as if by mutual
agreement. Now you see them dressing their plumage, now partially expanding
their wings to the sun; some lay themselves comfortably down
on the sand, while others, supported by one foot, stand side by side.
The waters again advance, and the Gulls all move off in search of food.
At length the time has arrived; small parties of a few pairs fly towards
the desert isles. Some remain in the nearest to prepare their nests,
the rest proceed, until each pair has found a suitable retreat, and before
a fortnight has elapsed, incubation has commenced.
</p>

<p>
The nest of this species is usually placed on the bare rock of some
low island, sometimes beneath a projecting shelf, sometimes in a wide fissure.
In Labrador it is formed of moss and seaweeds carefully arranged,
and has a diameter of about two feet, being raised on the edges to the
height of five or six inches, but seldom more than two inches thick in the
centre, where feathers, dry grass, and other materials are added. The
eggs are three, and in no instance have I found more. They are two
inches and seven-eighths in length, by two inches and one-eighth in breadth,
broadly ovate, rough but not granulated, of a pale earthy greenish-grey
colour, irregularly blotched and spotted with brownish-black, dark umber,
and dull purple. Like those of most other Gulls, they afford good eating.
This species lays from the middle of May to that of June, and
raises only one brood in the season. The birds never leave their eggs
for any length of time, until the young make their appearance. Both
sexes incubate, the sitting bird being supplied with food by the other.
During the first week, the young are fed by having their supplies disgorged
into their bill, but when they have attained some size, the food is
dropped beside or before them. When they are approached by man,
they walk with considerable speed towards some hiding place, or to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
nearest projecting ledge, beneath which they squat. When five or six
weeks old, they take to the water, to ensure their escape, and swim with
great buoyancy. If caught, they cry in the manner of their parents. On
the 18th of June, several small ones were procured and placed on the
deck of the Ripley, where they walked with ease and picked up the food
thrown to them. As soon as one was about to swallow its portion, another
would run up, seize it, tug at it, and if stronger, carry it off and devour
it. On the 23d of that month, two individuals, several weeks old,
and partly fledged, were also brought on board. Their notes, although
feeble, perfectly resembled those of their parents. They ate greedily of
every thing that was offered to them. When fatigued they sat with their
tarsi placed on the ground and extended forward, in the manner of all
the Herons, which gave them a very ludicrous appearance. Ere a month
had elapsed, they appeared to have formed a complete acquaintance
with the cook and several of the sailors, had become quite fat, and
conducted themselves much like Vultures, for if a dead Duck, or even a
Gull of their own species, were thrown to them, they would tear it in
pieces, drink the blood, and swallow the flesh in large morsels, each trying
to rob the others of what they had torn from the carcass. They never
drank water, but not unfrequently washed the blood and filth from their
bills, by immersing them and then shaking the head violently. These
birds were fed until they were nearly able to fly. Now and then, the
sailors would throw them overboard while we were in harbour. This
seemed to gratify the birds as well as the sailors, for they would swim
about, wash themselves, and dress their plumage, after which they would
make for the sides, and would be taken on board. During a violent gale,
one night, while we were at anchor in the harbour of Bras d’Or, our bark
rolled heavily, and one of our pets went over the side and swam to the
shore, where, after considerable search next day, it was found shivering
by the lee of a rock. On being brought to its brothers, it was pleasant
to see their mutual congratulations, which were extremely animated. Before
we left the coast, they would sometimes fly of their own accord into
the water to bathe, but could not return to the deck without assistance,
although they endeavoured to do so. I had become much attached to
them, and now and then thought they looked highly interesting, as they
lay panting on their sides on the deck, although the thermometer did not
rise above 55°. Their enmity to my son’s pointer was quite remarkable,
and as that animal was of a gentle and kindly disposition, they would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
tease him, bite him, and drive him fairly from the deck into the cabin.
A few days after leaving St George’s Bay in Newfoundland, we were assailed
by a violent gale, and obliged to lie-to. Next day one of the Gulls
was washed overboard. It tried to reach the vessel again, but in vain;
the gale continued; the sailors told me the bird was swimming towards
the shore, which was not so far off as we could have wished, and which it
probably reached in safety. The other was given to my friend Lieutenant
<span class="smcap">Green</span> of the United States Army, at Eastport in Maine. In one of his
letters to me the following winter, he said that the young <i>Larus marinus</i>
was quite a pet in the garrison, and doing very well, but that no perceptible
change had taken place in its plumage.
</p>

<p>
On referring to my journal again, I find that while we were at anchor
at the head of St George’s Bay, the sailors caught many codlings, of
which each of our young Gulls swallowed daily two, measuring from
eight to ten inches in length. It was curious to see them after such a
meal: the form of the fish could be traced along the neck, which for a
while they were obliged to keep stretched out; they gaped and were evidently
suffering; yet they would not throw up the fish. About the time
the young of this species are nearly able to fly, they are killed in considerable
numbers on their breeding grounds, skinned and salted for the settlers
and resident fishermen of Labrador and Newfoundland, at which
latter place I saw piles of them. When they are able to shift for themselves,
their parents completely abandon them, and old and young go separately
in search of food.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Great Black-backed Gull is firm, steady, at times
elegant, rather swift, and long protracted. While travelling, it usually
flies at the height of fifty or sixty yards, and proceeds in a direct course,
with easy regulated flappings. Should the weather prove tempestuous,
this Gull, like most others, skims over the surface of the waters or the
land within a few yards or even feet, meeting the gale, but not yielding
to it, and forcing its way against the strongest wind. In calm weather
and sunshine, at all seasons of the year, it is fond of soaring to a
great height, where it flies about leisurely and with considerable elegance
for half an hour or so, in the manner of eagles, vultures, and ravens. Now
and then, while pursuing a bird of its own species, or trying to escape
from an enemy, it passes through the air with rapid boundings, which,
however, do not continue long, and as soon as they are over it rises and
slowly sails in circles. When man encroaches on its domains, it keeps
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
over him at a safe distance, not sailing so much as moving to either side
with continued flappings. To secure the fishes on which it more usually
preys, it sweeps downwards with velocity, and as it glides over the spot,
picks up its prey with its bill. If the fish be small, the Gull swallows it
on wing, but if large, it either alights on the water, or flies to the nearest
shore to devour it.
</p>

<p>
Although a comparatively silent bird for three-fourths of the year,
the Great Black-backed Gull becomes very noisy at the approach of the
breeding season, and continues so until the young are well fledged, after
which it resumes its silence. Its common notes, when it is interrupted or
surprised, sound like <i>cack, cack, cack</i>. While courting, they are softer
and more lengthened, and resemble the syllables <i>cawah</i>, which are often
repeated as it sails in circles or otherwise, within view of its mate or its
place of abode.
</p>

<p>
This species walks well, moving firmly and with an air of importance.
On the water it swims lightly but slowly, and may soon be overtaken by
a boat. It has no power of diving, although at times, when searching
for food along the shores, it will enter the water on seeing a crab or a
lobster, to seize it, in which it at times succeeds. I saw one at Labrador
plunge after a large crab in about two feet of water, when, after
a tug, it hauled it ashore, where it devoured it in my sight. I watched
its movements with a glass, and could easily observe how it tore the crab
to pieces, swallowed its body, leaving the shell and the claws, after which
it flew off to its young and disgorged before them.
</p>

<p>
It is extremely voracious, and devours all sorts of food excepting vegetables,
even the most putrid carrion, but prefers fresh fish, young birds,
or small quadrupeds, whenever they can be procured. It sucks the eggs
of every bird it can find, thus destroying great numbers of them, as well
as the parents, if weak or helpless. I have frequently seen these Gulls
attack a flock of young Ducks while swimming beside their mother, when
the latter, if small, would have to take to wing, and the former would all
dive, but were often caught on rising to the surface, unless they happened
to be among rushes. The Eider Duck is the only one of the tribe that
risks her life, on such occasions, to save that of her young. She will frequently
rise from the water, as her brood disappear beneath, and keep
the Gull at bay, or harass it until her little ones are safe under some
shelving rocks, when she flies off in another direction, leaving the enemy
to digest his disappointment. But while the poor Duck is sitting on her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
eggs in any open situation, the marauder assails her, and forces her off,
when he sucks the eggs in her very sight. Young Grous are also the
prey of this Gull, which chases them over the moss-covered rocks, and
devours them before their parents. It follows the shoals of fishes for
hours at a time, and usually with great success. On the coast of Labrador,
I frequently saw these birds seize flounders on the edges of the shallows;
they often attempted to swallow them whole, but, finding this impracticable,
removed to some rock, beat them, and tore them to pieces.
They appear to digest feathers, bones, and other hard substances with
ease, seldom disgorging their food, unless for the purpose of feeding their
young or mates, or when wounded and approached by man, or when pursued
by some bird of greater power. While at Boston in Massachusetts,
one cold winter morning, I saw one of these Gulls take up an eel, about
fifteen or eighteen inches in length, from a mud bank. The Gull rose
with difficulty, and after some trouble managed to gulp the head of the
fish, and flew towards the shore with it, when a White-headed Eagle
made its appearance, and soon overtook the Gull, which reluctantly gave
up the eel, on which the Eagle glided towards it, and, seizing it with its
talons, before it reached the water, carried it off.
</p>

<p>
This Gull is excessively shy and vigilant, so that even at Labrador
we found it difficult to procure it, nor did we succeed in obtaining more
than about a dozen old birds, and that only by stratagem. They watched
our movements with so much care as never to fly past a rock behind which
one of the party might be likely to lie concealed. None were shot near
the nests when they were sitting on their eggs, and only one female attempted
to rescue her young, and was shot as she accidentally flew within
distance. The time to surprise them was during violent gales, for then
they flew close to the tops of the highest rocks, where we took care to conceal
ourselves for the purpose. When we approached the rocky islets on
which they bred, they left the place as soon as they became aware of our
intentions, cackled and barked loudly, and when we returned, followed us
at a distance more than a mile.
</p>

<p>
They begin to moult early in July. In the beginning of August the
young were seen searching for food by themselves, and even far apart.
By the 12th of that month they had all left Labrador. We saw them
afterwards along the coast of Newfoundland, and while crossing the Gulf
of St Lawrence, and found them over the bays of Nova Scotia, as we proceeded
southward. When old, their flesh is tough and unfit for food.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
Their feathers are elastic, and good for pillows and such purposes, but
can rarely be procured in sufficient quantity.
</p>

<p>
The most remarkable circumstance relative to these birds is, that they
either associate with another species, giving rise to a hybrid brood, or that
when very old they lose the dark colour of the back, which is then of
the same tint as that of the <i>Larus argentatus</i>, or even lighter. This
curious fact was also remarked by the young gentlemen who accompanied
me to Labrador; and although it is impossible for me to clear up the
doubts that may be naturally entertained on this subject, whichever of
the two suppositions is adopted, the fact may yet be established and accounted
for by persons who may have better opportunities of watching
them and studying their habits. No individuals of <i>Larus argentatus</i>
were, to my knowledge, seen on that coast during the three months which
I passed there, and the fishermen told us that the “saddle-backs were the
only large Gulls that ever breed there.”
</p>

<p>
This bird must be of extraordinary longevity, as I have seen one that
was kept in a state of captivity more than thirty years. The following
very interesting account of the habits of a partially domesticated individual
I owe to my esteemed and learned friend Dr <span class="smcap">Neill</span> of Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
“In the course of the summer of 1818, a “big scorie” was brought to
me by a Newhaven fisher-boy, who mentioned that it had been picked up
at sea, about the mouth of the Frith of Forth. The bird was not then
fully fledged: it was quite uninjured: it quickly learned to feed on potatoes
and kitchen refuse, along with some ducks; and it soon became
more familiar than they, often peeping in at the kitchen window in hopes
of getting a bit of fat meat, which it relished highly. It used to follow
my servant <span class="smcap">Peggy Oliver</span> about the doors, expanding its wings and vociferating
for food. After two moults I was agreeably surprised to find
it assuming the dark plumage of the back, and the shape and colour of
the bill of the <i>Larus marinus</i>, or Great Black-backed Gull; for I had
hitherto regarded it as merely a large specimen of the Lesser Black-backed
(<i>L. fuscus</i>), a pair of which I then possessed, but which had never allowed
the new comer to associate with them. The bird being perfectly
tame, we did not take the precaution of keeping the quills of one wing
cut short, so as to prevent flight; indeed, as it was often praised as a remarkably
large and noble looking Sea-maw, we did not like to disfigure
it. In the winter 1821-2, it got a companion in a cock-heron, which had
been wounded in Coldinghame Muir, brought to Edinburgh alive, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
kept for some weeks in a cellar in the old College, and then presented to
me by the late Mr <span class="smcap">John Wilson</span>, the janitor,—a person remarkably distinguished
for his attachment to natural history pursuits. This Heron
we succeeded in taming completely, and it still (1835) remains with me,
having the whole garden to range in, the trees to roost upon, and access
to the Loch at pleasure, the loch being the boundary of my garden.
Some time in the spring of 1822, the large Gull was amissing; and we
ascertained (in some way that has now escaped my memory) that it had
not been stolen, nor killed, as we at first supposed, but had taken flight,
passing northwards over the village, and had probably therefore gone to
sea. Of course I gave up all expectation of ever hearing more of it. It
was not without surprise, therefore, that on going home one day in the
end of October of that year, I heard my servant calling out with great
exultation, “Sir, Big Gull is come back!” I accordingly found him
walking about in his old haunts in the garden, in company with, and recognising
(as I am firmly persuaded) his old friend the Heron. He disappeared
in the evening, and returned in the morning, for several days;
when <span class="smcap">Peggy Oliver</span> thought it best to secure him. He evidently did
not like confinement, and it was concerted that he should be allowed
his liberty, although he ran much risk of being shot on the mill-pond by
youthful sportsmen from Edinburgh. After this temporary captivity,
he was more cautious and shy than formerly; but still he made almost
daily visits to the garden, and picked up herrings or other food laid down
for him. In the beginning of March 1823 his visits ceased; and we
saw no more of him till late in the autumn of that year. These winter
visits to Canonmills, and summer excursions to the unknown breeding-place,
were continued for years with great uniformity: only I remarked
that after the Gull lost his protectress, who died in 1828<a id='FA_A' href='#FN_A' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a>, he became
more distant in his manners. In my note-book, under date of 26th October
1829, I find this entry: ‘Old <span class="smcap">Peggy</span>’s Great Black-backed Gull
arrived at the pond this morning, the seventh (or eighth) winter he has
regularly returned. He had a scorie with him, which was soon shot on
the loch, by some cockney sportsman.’ The young bird, doubtless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
one of his offspring, had its wing shattered, and continued alive in the
middle of the pond, occasionally screaming piteously, for two or three
days, till relieved by death. The old Gull immediately abandoned the
place for that winter, as if reproaching us for cruelty. By next autumn,
however, he seemed to have forgotten the injury; for, according to my
record, ‘30th October 1830. The Great Black-backed Gull once more
arrived at Canonmills garden.’ The periods of arrival, residence, and
departure were nearly similar in the following year. But in 1832,
not only October, but the months of November and December passed
away without Gull’s making his appearance, and I of course despaired
of again seeing him. He did, however, at length arrive. The following
is the entry in my common-place book: ‘Sunday, 6th January 1833.
This day the Great Black-back returned to the mill-pond, for (I think)
the eleventh season. He used to re-appear in October in former years,
and I concluded him dead or shot. He recognised my voice, and hovered
over my head.’ He disappeared early in March as usual, and re-appeared
at Canonmills on 23d December 1833, being a fortnight earlier
than the date of his arrival in the preceding season, but six weeks later
than the original period of re-appearance. He left in the beginning of
March as usual, and I find from my notes that he ‘reappeared on 30th
December 1834 for the season, first hovering around and then alighting
on the pond as in former years.’ The latest entry is, ‘11th March
1835: The Black-backed Gull was here yesterday, but has not been seen
to-day; nor do I expect to see him till November.’

“This Gull has often attracted the attention of persons passing the village
of Canonmills, by reason of its sweeping along so low or near the
ground, and on account of the wide expanse of wing which it thus displays.
It is well known to the boys of the village as “<span class="smcap">Neill</span>’s Gull,”
and has, I am aware, owed its safety more than once to their interference,
in informing passing sportsmen of its history. When it first arrives
in the autumn, it is in the regular habit of making many circular
sweeps around the pond and garden, at a considerable elevation, as if reconnoitring;
it then gradually lowers its flight, and gently alights about
the centre of the pond. Upon the gardener’s mounting the garden-wall
with a fish in his hand, the Gull moves towards the overhanging spray
of some large willow-trees, so as to catch what may be thrown to him, before
it sinks in the water. There can be no doubt whatever of the identity
of the bird. Indeed, he unequivocally shews that he recognises my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
voice when I call aloud ‘Gull, Gull;’ for whether he be on wing or
afloat, he immediately approaches me.
</p>

<p>
“A few pairs of the Great Black-backed Gull breed at the Bass Rock
yearly, and it seems highly probable that my specimen had originally
been hatched there. If I may be allowed a conjecture, I would suppose
that, after attaining maturity, he for some years resorted to the same
spot for the purpose of breeding; but that of late years, having lost his
mate or encountered some other disaster, he has extended his migration
for that purpose to some very distant locality, which has rendered his return
to winter quarters six weeks later than formerly.”

<h2>
THE SNOWY HERON.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea candidissima</i>, Gmel.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXLII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
This beautiful species is a constant resident in Florida and Louisiana,
where thousands are seen during winter, and where many remain during
the breeding season. It is perhaps of a still more delicate constitution
than the Blue Heron, <i>Ardea cœrulea</i>, as no individuals remain in the
neighbourhood of Charleston when the winter happens to be rather colder
than usual. In its migrations eastward it rarely proceeds farther than
Long Island in the State of New York; few are seen in Massachusetts,
and none farther to the east. My friend Professor <span class="smcap">MacCulloch</span> never
heard of it in Nova Scotia, and I cannot imagine on what authority
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> stated that it inhabits the sea-coast of North America to the
Gulf of St Lawrence. My friend <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> also asserts, without mentioning
on what evidence, that, by pursuing an inland course, it reaches
its final destination in the wilds of Canada. It has not been observed in
any part of the western country; nay, it rarely ascends the Mississippi
as high as Memphis, or about two hundred miles from the mouth of the
Ohio, and cannot be said to be at all abundant much farther up the great
river than Natchez. In fact, the maritime districts furnish its favourite
places of resort, and it rarely proceeds farther inland than fifty or sixty
miles, not only in the flat portions of the Carolinas, but even in the Middle
States, where it prefers the islands along the Atlantic coast.
</p>

<p>
While I was at Charleston, in March 1831, few had arrived from the
Floridas by the 18th of that month, but on the 25th thousands were seen
in the marshes and rice fields, all in full plumage. They reach the shores
of New Jersey about the first week of May, when they may be seen on
all parts of the coast between that district and the Gulf of Mexico. On
the Mississippi, they seldom reach the low grounds about Natchez, where
they also breed, earlier than the period at which they appear in the Middle
States.
</p>

<p>
While migrating, they fly both by night and by day, in loose flocks
of from twenty to a hundred individuals, sometimes arranging themselves
in a broad front, then forming lines, and again proceeding in a straggling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
manner. They keep perfectly silent, and move at a height seldom exceeding
a hundred yards. Their flight is light, undetermined as it were,
yet well sustained, and performed by regular flappings, as in other birds
of the tribe. When they have arrived at their destination, they often go
to considerable distances to feed during the day, regularly returning at
the approach of night to their roosts on the low trees and bushes bordering
the marshes, swamps, and ponds. They are very gentle at this season,
and at all periods keep in flocks when not disturbed. At the approach
of the breeding season, many spend a great part of the day at their
roosting places, perched on the low trees principally growing in the water,
when every now and then they utter a rough guttural sort of sigh, raising
at the same moment their beautiful crest and loose recurved plumes, curving
the neck, and rising on their legs to their full height, as if about to
strut on the branches. They act in the same manner while on the ground
mating. Then the male, with great ardour, and with the most graceful
motions, passes and repasses for several minutes at a time before and around
the female, whose actions are similar, although she displays less ardour.
When disturbed on such occasions, they rise high in the air, sail about
and over the spot in perfect silence, awaiting the departure of the intruder,
then sweep along, exhibiting the most singular movements, now and then
tumbling over and over like the Tumbler Pigeon, and at length alight on
a tree. On the contrary, when you intrude upon them while breeding,
they rise silently on wing, alight on the trees near, and remain there until
you depart.
</p>

<p>
The Snowy Herons breed in large communities; and so very social
are they, that they do not appear even to attempt to disturb such other
birds as are wont to breed among them, the Night Herons, for instance,
the Green Herons, or the Boat-tailed Grakles. I have visited some of their
breeding grounds, where several hundred pairs were to be seen, and several
nests were placed on the branches of the same bush, so low at times
that I could easily see into them, although others were situated at a height
of ten or fifteen feet. In places where these birds are often disturbed,
they breed in taller trees, though rarely on very high ones. In the Floridas
I found their nests on low mangroves; but wherever they are placed
you find them fronting the water, over which, indeed, these Herons seem
fond of placing them. The nest, which is formed of dry sticks, is rather
small, and has a shallow cavity. The eggs are three, one inch and five-eighths
and a half in length, one and a quarter across, of a broadly elliptical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
form, and having a plain pale bluish-green colour. In the Middle
Districts, the usual time of laying is about the middle of May; in the
Carolinas a month sooner; and in the Floridas still earlier, as there, on
the 19th of May, I found the young in great numbers walking off their
nests on the mangrove branches, and, like those of the Louisiana Heron,
which also breeds in the same places, trying to escape by falling into the
water below, and swimming in search of hiding-places among the roots
and hanging branches. Both sexes incubate. Many of the eggs are destroyed
by Crows and Turkey Buzzards, which also devour the young,
and many are carried off by men.
</p>

<p>
The young acquire the full beauty of their plumage in the course of
the first spring, when they can no longer be distinguished from the old
birds. The legs and feet are at first of a darkish olive, as is the bill, except
at the base, where it is lighter, and inclining to yellow. At the approach
of autumn, the crest assumes a form, and the feathers of the lower
parts of the neck in front become considerably lengthened, the feet acquire
a yellow tint, and the legs are marked with black on a yellowish
ground; but the flowing feathers of the back do not appear until the approach
of spring, when they grow rapidly, become recurved, and remain
until the young are hatched, when they fall off.
</p>

<p>
The Snowy Heron, while in the Carolinas, in the month of April, resorts
to the borders of the salt-water marshes, and feeds principally on
shrimps. Many individuals which I opened there contained nothing else
in their stomach. On the Mississippi, at the time when the shrimps are
ascending the stream, these birds are frequently seen standing on floating
logs, busily engaged in picking them up; and on such occasions their
pure white colour renders them conspicuous and highly pleasing to the
eye. At a later period, they feed on small fry, fiddlers, snails, aquatic
insects, occasionally small lizards and young frogs. Their motions are
generally quick and elegant, and, while pursuing small fishes, they run
swiftly through the shallows, throwing up their wings. Twenty or thirty
seen at once along the margins of a marsh or a river, while engaged in
procuring their food, form a most agreeable sight. In autumn and early
spring, they are fond of resorting to the ditches of the rice fields, not unfrequently
in company with the Blue Herons. When, on being wounded
in the wing one falls into the water, it swims off towards the nearest
shore, and runs to hide itself by the side of some log, or towards a tree
which if possible it climbs, ascending to its very top. When seized, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
peck at you with great spirit, and are capable of inflicting a severe
wound.
</p>

<p>
There is no difference between the sexes as to plumage, but the male
is somewhat larger. When in good condition, its flesh is excellent eating,
especially in early autumn, when it is generally very fat. Some may be seen
for sale in the markets of New Orleans and other southern cities. They
return southward from the Middle Districts early in October, but in the
Carolinas they remain until the first frosts, when they all depart for the
Floridas, where I found them during the whole winter in considerable
numbers, associating with the Blue Herons.

<h2>
THE AMERICAN SNIPE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Scolopax Wilsonii</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXLIII. Male, Female, and Young in Autumn.</span>
</p>

<p>
The summer range of the Common American Snipe extends northward
to a considerable distance beyond the limits of the United States.
During the breeding season it is not to be found in our Southern Districts,
much less does it breed on the borders of the Mississippi, as has
been alleged by some writers. It may indeed sometimes happen that a
pair is found during summer in the mountainous districts of the Carolinas;
but occurrences of this kind are rare, and are probably caused by
one of the birds being disabled, and so prevented from prosecuting its
journey farther northward, although not incapacitated for reproduction.
Some pairs are more frequently met with in Virginia, Maryland and
Pennsylvania, either with eggs or with young, but the great body of this
species goes farther north for the purpose of breeding. In the State of
Maine, they become tolerably abundant at this season, and as you proceed
eastward you find them more numerous. In Nova Scotia they are
plentiful during summer, and there they breed in all convenient places.
</p>

<p>
In these northern districts, the Snipe begins to lay its eggs in the early
part of June. The swampy parts of the extensive moss-covered marshes
in elevated situations afford it places of security and comfort, in which it
is not likely to be disturbed by man, and finds immediately around it an
abundance of food. The nest itself is a mere hollow in the moss, scantily inlaid
with a few grasses. The eggs, which, like those of many of the Tringas,
are four, and placed with the small ends together, measure one inch and
five-eighths by one and one-eighth, being pyriform, with the tip somewhat
inflated. The ground colour is a yellowish-olive, pretty thickly
spotted and blotched with light and dark umber, the markings increasing
in size as they approach the large end, where they form a circle.
The young, like those of the Woodcock, leave the nests as soon as hatched,
and so resemble those of the Common Snipe of Europe, <i>Scolopax Gallinago</i>,
that the same description answers for both, they being covered
with down of different tints of brown and greyish-yellow. The bill is at
this age short, very soft and easily bent by the least pressure; nor does it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
acquire its full growth before winter, and its length differs in different
apparently full grown individuals, by half an inch or even three-fourths.
They seem to feed at first on minute insects collected on the surface
of the mires, or amid the grass and moss; but as they grow older, and
the bill becomes firmer and larger, they probe the ground like their
parents, and soon become expert at this operation, introducing the bill
at every half inch or so of the oozy mire, from which they principally
obtain their food. In the Middle States, this Snipe, however, has been
found breeding in meadows, as well as in the State of Maine; and it also
nestles in the mountainous districts of these parts of the Union. I never
had the good fortune to meet with a nest in Pennsylvania, although I
have known several instances of a pair breeding not far from Mill Grove
on the Perkioming.
</p>

<p>
In the Western Country this bird arrives from the north early in October,
alighting in the low meadows watered by warm springs, and along
the borders of ponds and small secluded rivulets, sometimes in the corn
fields after a continuance of rainy weather, but never in the woods or any
place from which it cannot easily make its escape when approached. In
Kentucky it often remains all winter, and is at times very abundant.
Farther south, it is more plentiful, especially in the lower parts of Louisiana,
where it is named “<i>cache cache</i>” by the Creoles, and over the
whole country between that State and the Carolinas. During winter, it
is not uncommon in Louisiana to meet with it in flocks of considerable
numbers, as is also the case in South Carolina, where the grounds of the
rice-planter afford it abundance of food. In some fields well known to
my Charleston friends, as winter retreats of the snipe, it is shot in great
numbers. At times it is so much less careful about concealing itself than
at others, that it is not at all uncommon to see it walking about over its
wet feeding-grounds, and on such occasions many are killed. In such
places I have found these birds by fifties and hundreds in fields of a few
acres. At the first shots, dozens in succession would take to wing, each
emitting its cry of <i>wau-aik</i>, after which they would rise in the air, gradually
collect, fly round a few times to the distance of some hundred
yards, and returning pitch towards the ground, and alight, with the velocity
of an arrow, not many yards from the spot where they had previously
been. In a few minutes they would all disperse, to seek for food. So
much are they at times attached to particular spots, that the sportsmen
continue to shoot them until their number is reduced to a few, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
having perhaps been several times shot at, become extremely wary, and
are left to entice others to join them, so that another day’s sport may be
obtained. It is not rare to find some of these birds in the immediate vicinity
of Charleston, when they are pursued by the younger gunners, and
sometimes by keen sportsmen. I have known eight or ten procured by
one person in a short time, between that city and the race-ground, which
is scarcely a mile distant. They are also abundant in the wet savannahs
in the Floridas, from which they retire a few weeks earlier than from
Louisiana and the Carolinas, where some remain until the beginning of
April. During the whole of the winter months, these birds are observed
to ramble from one place to another, and a field which yesterday contained
a good number, has only a few to-day, and to-morrow may be quite deserted.
But before the end of a week, there you will find them again,
as abundant as at first. They rarely visit salt waters, and never resort
to the interior of the woods.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Snipe while travelling to some distance, is performed
at a considerable elevation, by regular and quickly repeated beats of the
wings. Yet they do not appear as if pursuing a direct course, for every
now and then they deviate a little to either side. They pass over rapidly,
however, and are able to travel to a great distance in a short time. Their
migrations, although performed singly, or in small parties of a single family,
may be said to be in a manner continuous, as in the course of a few
days a whole section of country, in which none had been seen for several
months, becomes well supplied with them. When surprised by the sportsman,
or any other enemy, they usually rise at one spring, dash through
the air in a zig-zag course, a few feet from the ground, emit their cry
when about twenty yards distant, and at times continue to employ this
cunning mode of escape for sixty or seventy yards, after which they mount
into the air, and perform the rounds already described. I have found
the instant at which they utter their note of alarm the best for pulling
the trigger; but almost every sportsman has his peculiar fancy, and many
are glad to kill them the best way they can; for he who shoots thirty
snipes in succession, without missing one, is a good hand at any kind of
shooting. Sometimes the Snipe will squat with great pertinacity, and even
stand a pointer, while at other times it will not suffer either man or dog
to approach within fifty yards of it. This, however, depends much on
the state of the atmosphere. The finer and warmer the day, the easier I
have found it to get near them, and the smaller is the distance at which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
they realight; whereas during drizzly weather, they fly off to a great distance.
When the Snipe alights within sight, and you are concealed and
silent, its movements can easily be observed. It first stands for an instant
in a half crouching attitude, as if to listen, then raises itself and
runs a few steps, when, if it be in any degree apprehensive of danger, it
squats, and there remains until put up. If all around is quiet, you see
it move in its ordinary manner, walking lightly, and with some grace, its
bill half inclined downwards, in search of a good spot to probe for food.
The instant it meets with this it sets to work, and thrusts its bill into the
mud or the damp soil, to a depth determined by the degree of softness of
the ground, repeating its thrusts eight, ten, or more times in quick succession.
When it has thus examined a spot, and perhaps found some
food, it walks off in search of another, and thus continues until it is satisfied,
when it generally lays itself down in a soft tuft of grass until the approach
of night, when it flies off and rambles about for exercise in comparative
security. When wounded, it runs with moderate speed, but, if
closely pursued, squats whenever a good opportunity occurs. It will at
times continue to run for fifty or more yards, after which, if you have not
a good dog, it is next to impossible to find it, for on such occasions it remains
perfectly silent. While travelling eastward from Charleston, in
the month of March, I found this Snipe perhaps more abundant near the
Great Santee River than any where else. We could see them with ease
from the carriage as they were walking over the rice-fields, as if in perfect
assurance of security.
</p>

<p>
The food of our Common Snipe consists principally of ground worms,
insects, and the juicy slender roots of different vegetables, all of which
tend to give its flesh that richness of flavour and juicy tenderness, for
which it is so deservedly renowned, it being equal to that of the woodcock.
Many epicures eat up both Snipe and Woodcock with all their
viscera, worms and insects to boot, the intestines in fact being considered
the most savoury parts. On opening some newly killed Snipes, I have
more than once found fine large and well-fed ground worms, and at times
a leech, which I must acknowledge I never conceived suitable articles of
food for man, and, for this reason, I have always taken good care to have
both Snipes and Woodcocks well cleaned, as all game ought to be.
</p>

<p>
To <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> is due the merit of having first shewn the difference between
this bird and the Common Snipe of Europe; and it is honourable
for the ornithologists of that region of the globe to have dedicated our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' href='#Page_326'>326</a></span>
species to so zealous and successful a student of nature. I have, however,
been surprised that he should not have mentioned the difference in
the notes of the two species, which in fact is as great as that between those
of the American Crow and the Carrion Crow of Europe. A decided
difference of this kind I am always disposed to consider as satisfactory in
the case of nearly allied species. While glancing over some of the numberless
compilations that are pouring their muddy waters into the great
stream of human knowledge, I was somewhat surprised to find in one of
them an account of the American Snipe, in which it is stated that it is a
<i>winter</i> visitant in the <i>northern</i> States, and will most probably breed farther
<i>south</i>, without leaving the country!
</p>

<p>
The American Snipe is easily caught in snares placed on the spots of
mud which it is wont to probe, and a good number are thus obtained by
the farmers’ children, especially during very cold weather, when, the birds
having become emaciated from want of a good supply of food, they resort
to the small warm springs of our meadows, and there remain until
the return of milder weather. At such times and places, I have heard
this bird utter various curious notes, which I am unable to describe, putting
themselves into strange postures all the while, jerking their tails upwards,
downwards, and sideways, for several seconds at a time, while the
head and neck were moved backwards and forwards, as if the bird had
been in a fit. I never saw this during warm weather, and am unable to
account for it.
</p>

<p>
It arrives in Pennsylvania from the south about the middle of March,
earlier or later according to the nature of the season, a month later in
Maine, and about a week or ten days after in Nova Scotia. We neither
saw nor heard of any in Newfoundland or Labrador, but they are abundant
in the interior of the northern parts of the Canadas.
</p>

<p>
The young acquire the full plumage of the adult the first year after their
birth, when no essential difference is perceptible between the sexes, the
female being merely somewhat larger than the male. My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas
MacCulloch</span>, who has not unfrequently found this bird breeding, and
from whom I have received many of its eggs, was unable to say whether
both sexes incubate, although this is very probable, as the male is often
seen with or near the female while she is sitting, excepting towards evening
or in the early part of the morning, when he mounts into the air, as if for
the purpose of congratulating her by his curious song. It often happens
that before these birds depart in spring, many are already mated. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
birds are then met with in meadows or on low grounds, and, by being on
the spot before sunrise, you may see both mount high in the air in a spiral
manner, now with continuous beats of the wings, now in short sailings,
until more than a hundred yards high, when they whirl round each other
with extreme velocity, and dance as it were to their own music; for at this
juncture, and during the space of five or six minutes, you hear rolling
notes mingling together, each more or less distinct, perhaps according to
the state of the atmosphere. The sounds produced are extremely pleasing,
though they fall faintly on the ear. I know not how to describe
them, but I am well assured that they are not produced simply by the
beatings of the wings, as at this time the wings are not flapped, but are
used in sailing swiftly in a circle not many feet in diameter. A person
might cause a sound somewhat similar by blowing rapidly and alternately
from one end to another, across a set of small pipes consisting of two or three
modulations. This performance is kept up until incubation terminates,
but I never observed it at any other period. Our Woodcock produces a
somewhat similar sound at the same season, and also at times on fine autumnal
evenings, as I shall mention more particularly when describing
that bird.
</p>

<p>
In confinement, our Common Snipe feeds freely on moistened Indian
corn meal, mixed with some insects, but rarely becomes as gentle as the
Woodcock in similar circumstances. When approached, it droops its
wings and runs round its place of confinement, even should it be a small
room, keeping its tail spread out on the side next you. If the bird is
confined in a small space in front of you, it alternately throws the tail upwards,
and spreads it in the manner mentioned at every successive turn to
and from each corner. Sometimes it emits a lisping sound, but is more
usually silent.

<h2>
THE COMMON GALLINULE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Gallinula Chloropus</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXLIV. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
The two species of Gallinule which occur in the United States are
confined within a comparatively small range in that extensive country,
the southern portions of which appear to suit them better, at all seasons
of the year, than the other districts. The Common Gallinule is extremely
abundant during winter along the rivers, fresh-water creeks, lagoons,
ponds and lakes, between the Gulf of Mexico and the eastern shores of
the Floridas, while in spring and summer a good number migrate eastward
into the Carolinas, and now and then a few stragglers may be seen
on the fresh waters of the Middle Districts, beyond which none, to my
knowledge, have ever been observed. They seldom ascend any of our
southern streams to any considerable distance, few are ever met with many
miles above Natchez on the Mississippi, and none are to be seen in the
Western Country.
</p>

<p>
In general they are equally diurnal and nocturnal in their habits, and
when undisturbed frequent the land as much as the water. In the lower
parts of Louisiana and the Floridas, I have seen them seek their food and
amuse themselves by day in the pastures and fields, and I have observed
both them and the Gallinules of England enacting their courtship, while
the sun was yet high above the horizon. In sight of man, however, they
are timorous although not shy, and retreat from him among the grass and
sedges bordering the water, to which they resort for safety. If shot at,
or otherwise frightened, they run with speed, and either fly or swim off
as fast as possible, to elude their enemy.
</p>

<p>
During my various temporary residences in London, I have often seen
the Gallinules resort to the grounds in the Regent’s Park at all hours of
the day. They were there in a manner partially domesticated, and walked
quite unconcernedly in the meadows, led their young over the water, and
paid their addresses to each other, while fifty or more persons were amusing
themselves with feeding the ducks and swans over the bridge leading
to the inner circle, and within sight of these birds. While I was at
Spring-Garden Spring in East Florida, in the early part of January, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
Gallinules were seen in great numbers on every bayou leading towards
the waters of the St John, and at that early period the manifestations of
their amatory propensity were quite remarkable. The male birds courted
the females, both on the land and on the water; they frequently spread
out their tail like a fan, and moved round each other, emitting a murmuring
sound for some seconds. The female would afterwards walk to the
water’s edge, stand in the water up to her breast, and receive the caresses
of the male, who immediately after would strut on the water before her,
jerking with rapidity his spread tail for a while, after which they would
both resume their ordinary occupations. This was in the middle of the
day, when I could have counted eight or ten pairs in sight.
</p>

<p>
The nest is formed with more labour than art, being composed of a
quantity of withered rushes and plants, interwoven in a circular form,
frequently from two to three inches thick in the centre, surrounded by an
edge or brim four or five inches high. If not greatly disturbed, these
birds raise several broods in a season, using the same nest, and making
additions to it previous to depositing each new set of eggs. In Lower
Louisiana I found it usually five or six feet from the water, among the
rankest weeds, along the bayous and lakes, which are so numerous there.
In some instances it was placed on a prostrate trunk of a tree over the
water, when the materials of which it was composed were less abundant
than in other circumstances. I never saw one floating loose, but have
often heard people say they had occasionally seen a nest in that state, although
I am not much disposed to give credit to such assertions. The
number of eggs seldom exceeds eight or nine, and is more frequently from
five to seven. As the bird lays more than once, its progeny is thus numerous.
The Gallinules cover their eggs when they leave them, no doubt
to protect them from crows and other enemies, but return to them as soon
as food has been procured, although both sexes incubate. The eggs
measure an inch and five-eighths, by an inch and one and a half eighths,
and are of a dull darkish cream colour, spotted and dotted with various
tints of reddish-brown and umber.
</p>

<p>
The females are as assiduous in their attentions to their young as the
wild Turkey Hens; and, although the young take to the water as soon
as hatched, the mother frequently calls them ashore, when she nurses and
dries them under her body and wings. In this manner she looks after
them until they are nearly a month old, when she abandons them and begins
to breed again. The young, which are covered with hairy, shining,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' href='#Page_332'>332</a></span>
black down, swim beautifully, jerking their heads forward at each movement
of their feet. They seem to grow surprisingly fast, and at the age
of six or seven weeks are strong, active, and perhaps as well able to elude
their enemies as the old birds are. Their food consists of grasses, seeds,
water-insects, worms, and snails, along with which they swallow a good
deal of sand or gravel. They walk and run over the broad leaves of water-lilies,
as if on land, dive if necessary, and appear at times to descend into
the water in search of food, although I cannot positively assert that they
do so.
</p>

<p>
On more than one occasion, I have seen a flock of these young birds
playing on the surface of the water like Ducks, beating it with their
wings, and splashing it about in a curious manner, when their gambols
would attract a garfish, which at a single dart would seize one of
them and disappear. The rest affrighted would run as it were with inconceivable
velocity on the surface of the water, make for the shore, and
there lie concealed and silent for a quarter of an hour or so. In the
streams and ponds of the Floridas, this species and some others of similar
habits, suffer greatly from Alligators and Turtles, as well as from various
kinds of fish, although, on account of their prolific nature, they are
yet abundant.
</p>

<p>
This Gallinule seldom resorts to salt water, but at times is met with
on the banks of bayous in which the water is brackish. This, however,
happens only during winter. On land it walks somewhat like a chicken,
and thirty, forty, or more individuals may be seen searching for worms
and insects among the grass, which they also nip in the manner of the
domestic fowl. On such occasions, the constantly repeated movements of
their tail are rendered conspicuous by the pure white of the feathers beneath
it, which, along with the white stripes on the flanks, and in spring
the vivid red of the frontal plate, renders their general appearance quite
interesting. In cases of danger, they run with great speed, and easily
conceal themselves. On the water they sit very lightly, and swim with
activity, the movements of their head and neck keeping pace with those
of their feet. They pick up their food from either side, continually jerk
their tail, and not unfrequently touch the water with it.
</p>

<p>
Although not a migratory bird, this species flies very well, whenever
it has occasion to rise from the ground. Its wings, although concave,
are large for its size, more so in fact than those of <i>Rallus crepitans</i>, which
migrates to a considerable extent. But in general, the Gallinules are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' href='#Page_333'>333</a></span>
averse from flying, unless when anxious to remove from one lake or stream
to another, when they rise fifty or sixty feet in the air, and fly with ease
and considerable velocity, by continued flappings, the neck and legs
stretched out. At all other times when raised, they suffer their legs to
dangle, proceed slowly to a short distance, and drop among the reeds,
or, if over the water, they dive and hide, leaving nothing but the bill
projecting above the surface.
</p>

<p>
The young in autumn have not attained their full size; their colours
are much duller than those of the old birds, particularly the stripes on
the flanks and under the tail, which are of a dull cream colour instead of
being pure white. The frontal plate is small, and almost covered by the
feathers around it; the legs and feet are of a dingy green, and the red
band on the tibia is scarcely apparent. In spring they acquire their full
plumage, but the frontal plate increases in size for several years.
</p>

<p>
There are great differences as to size between birds of both sexes.
The male from which I drew the figure in the plate, was of an average
size, having been selected from a bagful procured expressly for the purpose.
Our Gallinule corresponds so precisely with that of Europe, that
I cannot hesitate in affirming that it is the same species.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On comparing together a great number of European and American
specimens, I can find no specific differences. Individuals of either kind
are larger or smaller, their frontal plates differ in size and somewhat in
form, as do the bill and the claws; but if the species are really different,
Nature has made them so wonderfully like each other, that there
seems to me no possibility of distinguishing them.
</p>

<p>
My friend Dr <span class="smcap">Neill</span> has furnished me with the following anecdotes
illustrative of the habits of this bird. “At Canonmills Loch, near Edinburgh,
a pair (or sometimes two pairs) of water-hens breed yearly, making
their nest on the branches of some very large <i>saughs</i> (willow-trees,
<i>Salix russeliana</i>) growing in my garden, and overhanging the pond. One
season (four or five years ago) finding themselves persecuted by a tame
heron, which watched and devoured their first young brood (for we detected
him in the act), they formed their next nest more than <i>fifteen</i> feet
high on the trunk of the willow-tree. There the eggs were hatched in
safety, four or five young being in due time seen sailing about with the
old birds. We had only one pair on the Loch last summer. How they
descended to the water can only be conjectured: they might have crept
downwards three or four feet, but they must at all events have fallen at
once from a height of not less than twelve feet. When the pond is frozen
over and covered with skaters, the water-hens enter the garden and conceal
themselves in an overgrown rock-work, subsisting on minced flesh
mixed with bread or potatoes, purposely laid down for them, and on which
I have often watched them feasting when the snow was lying deep.”

<p>
I have never observed this bird on any part of the coast of our Middle
Districts, and, although I was told that it not unfrequently occurred
about the Bay of Boston, I failed in my endeavours to procure it there.
The specimen from which my figure was made was sent to me in ice, along
with several other rare birds, from Eastport in Maine. I received it quite
fresh and in excellent plumage, on the 18th of February 1833. It had
been shot along with several other individuals of the same species while
searching for food in the waters of Pasmaquody Bay, which were then
covered with broken ice. Its flight was described by Mr <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>, who
sent it to me, as similar to that of the Foolish Guillemot, with which it
associated. No other information was transmitted, excepting that it dived
and swam like the other species. I afterwards sent the skin to my friend
<span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, in whose collection it remains.
</p>

<p>
No individuals of this species were observed by my party on our way
to Labrador; and as the Foolish Guillemot was abundant on the coast of
that country, I concluded that the Thick-billed Guillemots which visit
our eastern seas in winter, set out for the far north at an earlier period
than the others. I am indebted to Mr <span class="smcap">Hewitson</span> of Newcastle, author
of the “British Oology,” for a description of an egg of this bird, which
is in the valuable collection of the Messrs <span class="smcap">Hancocks</span>, who procured it
from Greenland. It measures
<span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> inches in length, by
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> at its broadest
part, and is of a bluish-green colour, streaked and spotted with black or
very dark umber.

<h2>
PITTING OF WOLVES.
</h2>

<p>
There seems to be a universal feeling of hostility among men against
the Wolf, whose strength, agility, and cunning, which latter is scarcely inferior
to that of his relative master Reynard, tend to render him an object of
hatred, especially to the husbandman, on whose flocks he is ever apt to
commit depredations. In America, where this animal was formerly abundant,
and in many parts of which it still occurs in considerable numbers,
it is not more mercifully dealt with than in other parts of the world.
Traps and snares of all sorts are set for catching it, while dogs and horses
are trained for hunting the Fox. The Wolf, however, unless in some way
injured, being more powerful and perhaps better winded than the Fox, is
rarely pursued with hounds or any other dogs in open chase; but as his
depredations are at times extensive and highly injurious to the farmer,
the greatest exertions have been used to exterminate his race. Few instances
have occurred among us of any attack made by Wolves on man,
and only one has come under my own notice.
</p>

<p>
Two young Negroes who resided near the banks of the Ohio, in the
lower part of the State of Kentucky, about twenty-three years ago, had
sweethearts living on a plantation ten miles distant. After the labours
of the day were over, they frequently visited the fair ladies of their choice,
the nearest way to whose dwelling lay directly across a great cane brake.
As to the lover every moment is precious, they usually took this route,
to save time. Winter had commenced, cold, dark, and forbidding, and
after sunset scarcely a glimpse of light or glow of warmth, one might imagine,
could be found in that dreary swamp, excepting in the eyes
and bosoms of the ardent youths, or the hungry Wolves that prowled
about. The snow covered the earth, and rendered them more easy
to be scented from a distance by the famished beasts. Prudent in a
certain degree, the young lovers carried their axes on their shoulders,
and walked as briskly as the narrow path would allow. Some transient
glimpses of light now and then met their eyes, but so faint were they
that they believed them to be caused by their faces coming in contact
with the slender reeds covered with snow. Suddenly, however, a long
and frightful howl burst upon them, and they instantly knew that it
proceeded from a troop of hungry, perhaps desperate Wolves. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
stopped, and putting themselves in an attitude of defence, awaited the
result. All around was dark, save a few feet of snow, and the silence
of night was dismal. Nothing could be done to better their situation,
and after standing a few minutes in expectation of an attack, they judged
it best to resume their march; but no sooner had they replaced their
axes on their shoulders, and begun to move, than the foremost found
himself assailed by several foes. His legs were held fast as if pressed by
a powerful screw, and the torture inflicted by the fangs of the ravenous
animal was for a moment excruciating. Several Wolves in the mean
time sprung upon the breast of the other Negro, and dragged him to
the ground. Both struggled manfully against their foes; but in a short
time one of them ceased to move, and the other, reduced in strength,
and perhaps despairing of maintaining his ground, still more of aiding
his unfortunate companion, sprung to the branch of a tree, and speedily
gained a place of safety near the top. The next morning, the mangled
remains of his comrade lay scattered around on the snow, which was
stained with blood. Three dead Wolves lay around, but the rest of
the pack had disappeared, and Scipio, sliding to the ground, took up
the axes, and made the best of his way home, to relate the sad adventure.
</p>

<p>
About two years after this occurrence, as I was travelling between
Henderson and Vincennes, I chanced to stop for the night at a farmer’s
house by the side of the road. After putting up my horse and refreshing
myself, I entered into conversation with mine host, who asked if I
should like to pay a visit to the wolf-pits, which were about half a mile
distant. Glad of the opportunity I accompanied him across the fields
to the neighbourhood of a deep wood, and soon saw the engines of destruction.
He had three pits, within a few hundred yards of each
other. They were about eight feet deep, and broader at bottom, so
as to render it impossible for the most active animal to escape from
them. The aperture was covered with a revolving platform of twigs,
attached to a central axis. On either surface of the platform was
fastened a large piece of putrid venison, with other matters by no
means pleasant to my olfactory nerves, although no doubt attractive to
the Wolves. My companion wished to visit them that evening, merely
as he was in the habit of doing so daily, for the purpose of seeing that all
was right. He said that Wolves were very abundant that autumn, and
had killed nearly the whole of his sheep and one of his colts, but that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
he was now “paying them off in full;” and added that if I would tarry
a few hours with him next morning, he would beyond a doubt shew me
some sport rarely seen in those parts. We retired to rest in due time,
and were up with the dawn.
</p>

<p>
“I think,” said my host, “that all’s right, for I see the dogs are
anxious to get away to the pits, and although they are nothing but curs,
their noses are none the worse for that.” As he took up his gun, an
axe and a large knife, the dogs began to howl and bark, and whisked
around us, as if full of joy. When we reached the first pit, we found
the bait all gone, and the platform much injured; but the animal that
had been entrapped had scraped a subterranean passage for himself and
so escaped. On peeping into the next, he assured me that “three famous
fellows were safe enough” in it. I also peeped in and saw the
Wolves, two black, and the other brindled, all of goodly size, sure
enough. They lay flat on the earth, their ears laid close over the head,
their eyes indicating fear more than anger. “But how are we to get
them out?”—“How Sir,” said the farmer, “why by going down to be
sure, and ham-stringing them.” Being a novice in these matters, I begged
to be merely a looker-on. “With all my heart,” quoth the farmer,
“stand here, and look at me through the brush.” Whereupon he glided
down, taking with him his axe and knife, and leaving his rifle to
my care. I was not a little surprised to see the cowardice of the Wolves.
He pulled out successively their hind legs, and with a side stroke of the
knife cut the principal tendon above the joint, exhibiting as little fear as
if he had been marking lambs.
</p>

<p>
“Lo!” exclaimed the farmer, when he had got out, “we have forgot
the rope; I’ll go after it.” Off he went accordingly, with as much
alacrity as any youngster could shew. In a short time he returned out
of breath, and wiping his forehead with the back of his hand—“Now
for it.” I was desired to raise and hold the platform on its central balance,
whilst he, with all the dexterity of an Indian, threw a noose over
the neck of one of the Wolves. We hauled it up motionless with fright,
as if dead, its disabled legs swinging to and fro, its jaws wide open, and
the gurgle in its throat alone indicating that it was alive. Letting him
drop on the ground, the farmer loosened the rope by means of a stick,
and left him to the dogs, all of which set upon him with great fury and
soon worried him to death. The second was dealt with in the same manner;
but the third, which was probably the oldest, as it was the blackest,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
shewed some spirit, the moment it was left loose to the mercy of the
curs. This Wolf, which we afterwards found to be a female, scuffled
along on its fore legs at a surprising rate, giving a snap every now and
then to the nearest dog, which went off howling dismally with a mouthful
of skin torn from its side. And so well did the furious beast defend
itself, that apprehensive of its escape, the farmer levelled his rifle
at it, and shot it through the heart, on which the curs rushed upon it,
and satiated their vengeance on the destroyer of their master’s flock.

<h2>
THE EIDER DUCK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula mollissima</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXLVI. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
The history of this remarkable duck must ever be looked upon with
great interest by the student of nature. The depressed form of its body,
the singular shape of its bill, the beautiful colouring of its plumage, the
value of its down as an article of commerce, and the nature of its haunts,
render it a very remarkable species. Considering it as such, I shall endeavour
to lay before you as full an account of it as I have been able to
obtain from my own observation.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the Eider Duck breeds on our eastern coasts, must be
interesting to the American Ornithologist, whose fauna possesses but few
birds of this family that do so. The Fuligulæ are distinguished from all
other ducks that feed in fresh or salt water, by the comparative shortness
of the neck, the greater expansion of their feet, the more depressed form
of their body, and their power of diving to a considerable depth, in order
to reach the beds on which their favourite shelly food abounds. Their
flight, too, differs from that of the true ducks, inasmuch as it is performed
nearer the surface of the water. Rarely, indeed, do the Fuligulæ fly at
any considerable height over that element, and with the exception of three
species, they are rarely met with inland, unless when driven thither by
storms. They differ, moreover, in their propensity to breed in communities,
and often at a very small distance from each other. Lastly, they
are in general more ready to abandon their females, the moment incubation
has commenced. Thus the female is left in a state of double responsibility,
which she meets, however, with a courage equal to the occasion,
although alone and unprotected.
</p>

<p>
The Eider is now seldom seen farther south along our eastern coast
than the vicinity of New York. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> says they are occasionally observed
as far as the Capes of Delaware; but at the present day this must
be an extremely rare occurrence, for the fishermen of the Jerseys informed
me that they knew nothing of this duck. In <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s time, however,
it bred in considerable numbers, from Boston to the Bay of Fundy, and
it is still to be met with on the rocky shores and islands between these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
points. Farther to the eastward they become more and more plentiful,
until you reach Labrador, to which thousands of pairs annually resort, to
breed and spend the short summer. Many, however, proceed much farther
north; but, as usual, I will here confine myself to my own observations.
</p>

<p>
In the latter part of October 1832, the Eiders were seen in considerable
numbers in the Bay of Boston. A large bagful of them was brought
to me by a fisherman-gunner in my employ, a person advanced in years,
formerly a brave tar, and one whom I feel some pride in telling you I
assisted in obtaining a small pension from our government, being supported
in my application by two of my Boston friends, the one the generous
<span class="smcap">George Parkman</span>, M. D., the other that great statesman <span class="smcap">John
Quincey Adams</span>. The old man had once served under my father, and
to receive a bagful of Eider Ducks from him was a gratification which
you may more easily conceive than I can describe. Well, there were the
ducks, all turned out on the floor; young males still resembling their
mother, others of more advanced age, and several males and females complete
in all their parts, only that the bills of the former had lost the orange
tint, which that part exhibits during a few weeks of the breeding season.
Twenty-one there were in all, and they had been killed in a single day by
the veteran and his son. Those masterly gunners told me, that to procure
this species, they were in the habit of anchoring their small vessel
about fifty yards off the rocky isles round which these birds harbour and
feed at this season. There, while the birds were passing on wing, although
usually in long lines, they could now and then kill two of them at
a shot. Sometimes the King Eider was also procured under similar circumstances,
as the two species are wont to associate together during winter.
At Boston the Eiders sold that winter at from fifty to seventy-five
cents the pair, and they are much sought after by Epicures.
</p>

<p>
On the 31st of May 1833, my son and party killed six Eiders on the
island of Grand Manan, off the Bay of Fundy, where the birds were
seen in considerable numbers, and were just beginning to breed. A nest
containing two eggs, but not a particle of down, was found at a distance
of more than fifty yards from the water.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after landing on the coast of Labrador, on the 18th of
June in the same year, we saw a great number of “Sea Ducks,” as the
gunners and fishermen on that coast, as well as on our own, call the Eiders
and some other species. On visiting an island in “Partridge Bay,” we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' href='#Page_344'>344</a></span>
procured several females. The birds there paid little attention to us, and
some allowed us to approach within a few feet before they left their nests,
which were so numerous that a small boat-load might have been collected,
had the party been inclined. They were all placed amid the short grass
growing in the fissures of the rock, and therefore in rows, as it were. The
eggs were generally five or six, in several instances eight, and in one ten.
Not a male bird was to be seen. At the first discharge of the guns, all
the sitting birds flew off and alighted in the sea, at a distance of about a
hundred yards. They then collected, splashed up the water, and washed
themselves, until the boat left the place. Many of the nests were unprovided
with down; some had more or less than others, and some, from
which the female was absent when the party landed, were quite covered
with it, and the eggs felt warm to the hand. The musquitoes and flies
were there as abundant and as tormenting as in any of the Florida swamps.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of the same month, two male Eiders, much advanced in
the moult, were shot out of a flock all composed of individuals of the
same sex. While rambling over the moss-covered shores of a small
pond, on the 7th of July, we saw two females with their young on the
water. As we approached the edges, the old birds lowered their heads
and swam off with those parts lying flat on the surface, while the young
followed so close as almost to touch them. On firing at them without
shot, they all dived at once, but rose again in a moment, the mothers
quacking and murmuring. The young dived again, and we saw no more
of them; the old birds took to wing, and, flying over the hills, made for
the sea, from which we were fully a mile distant. How their young were
to reach it was at that time to me a riddle; but was afterwards rendered
intelligible, as you will see in the sequel. On the 9th of July, while
taking an evening walk, I saw flocks of female Eiders without broods.
They were in deep moult, kept close to the shore in a bay, and were probably
sterile birds. On my way back to the vessel, the captain and I
started a female from a broad flat rock, more than a hundred yards from
the water, and, on reaching the spot, we found her nest, which was placed
on the bare surface, without a blade of grass within five yards of it. It
was of the usual bulky construction, and contained five eggs, deeply
buried in down. She flew round us until we retired, when we had the
pleasure to see her alight, walk to her nest, and compose herself upon it.
</p>

<p>
Large flocks of males kept apart, and frequented the distant sea islands
at this period, when scarcely any were able to fly to any distance, although
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' href='#Page_345'>345</a></span>
they swam about from one island to another with great ease. Before their
moulting had commenced, or fully a month earlier, these male birds, we
observed, flew in long lines from place to place around the outermost
islands every morning and evening, thus securing themselves from their
enemies, and roosted in numbers close together on some particular rock
difficult to be approached by boats, where they remained during the short
night. By the 1st of August scarcely an Eider Duck was to be seen on
the coast of Labrador. The young were then able to fly, the old birds
had nearly completed their moult, and all were moving southward.
</p>

<p>
Having now afforded you some idea of the migrations and general
habits of this interesting bird from spring to the close of the short summer
of the desolate regions of Labrador, I proceed, with my journals before
me, and my memory refreshed by reading my notes, to furnish you
with such details as may perhaps induce you to study its habits in other
parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
The Eider Duck generally arrives on the coasts of Newfoundland and
Labrador about the 1st of May, nearly a fortnight before the waters of
the Gulf of St Lawrence are freed from ice. None are seen there during
winter, and their first appearance is looked upon with pleasure by the few
residents as an assurance of the commencement of the summer season.
At this period they are seen passing in long files not many feet above the
ice or the surface of the water, along the main shores, and around the
inner bays or islands, as if in search of the places where they had formerly
nestled, or where they had been hatched. All the birds appear to
be paired, and in perfect plumage. After a few days, during which they
rest themselves on the shores fronting the south, most of them remove to
the islands that border the coast, at distances varying from half a mile to
five or six miles. The rest seek for places in which to form their nests,
along the craggy shores, or by the borders of the stunted fir woods not
far from the water, a few proceeding as far as about a mile into the interior.
They are now seen only in pairs, and they soon form their nests.
I have never had an opportunity of observing their courtships, nor have
I received any account of them worthy of particular notice.
</p>

<p>
In Labrador, the Eider Ducks begin to form their nests about the
last week of May. Some resort to islands scantily furnished with grass,
near the tufts of which they construct their nests; others form them beneath
the spreading boughs of the stunted firs, and in such places, five,
six, or even eight are sometimes found beneath a single bush. Many are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' href='#Page_346'>346</a></span>
placed on the sheltered shelvings of rocks a few feet above high-water
mark, but none at any considerable elevation, at least none of my party,
including the sailors, found any in such a position. The nest, which is
sunk as much as possible into the ground, is formed of sea-weeds, mosses,
and dried twigs, so matted and interlaced as to give an appearance of neatness
to the central cavity, which rarely exceeds seven inches in diameter. In
the beginning of June the eggs are deposited, the male attending upon
the female the whole time. The eggs, which are regularly placed on the
moss and weeds of the nest, without any down, are generally from five to
seven, three inches in length, two inches and one eighth in breadth, being
thus much larger than those of the domestic Duck, of a regular oval
form, smooth-shelled, and of a uniform pale olive green. I may here
mention, by the way, that they afford delicious eating. I have not been
able to ascertain the precise period of incubation. If the female is not
disturbed, or her eggs removed or destroyed, she lays only one set in the
season, and as soon as she begins to sit the male leaves her. When the
full complement of eggs has been laid, she begins to pluck some down
from the lower parts of her body; this operation is daily continued for
some time, until the roots of the feathers, as far forward as she can reach,
are quite bare, and as clean as a wood from which the undergrowth has
been cleared away. This down she disposes beneath and around the
eggs. When she leaves the nest to go in search of food, she places it
over the eggs, and in this manner, it may be presumed to keep up their
warmth, although it does not always ensure their safety, for the Black-backed
Gull is apt to remove the covering, and suck or otherwise destroy
the eggs.
</p>

<p>
No sooner are the young hatched than they are led to the water, even
when it is a mile distant, and the travelling difficult, both for the parent
bird and her brood; but when it happens that the nest has been placed
among rocks over the water, the Eider, like the Wood Duck, carries the
young in her bill to their favourite element. I felt very anxious to find
a nest placed over a soft bed of moss or other plants, to see, whether, like
the Wood Duck on such occasions, the Eider would suffer her young ones
to fall from the nest; but unfortunately I had no opportunity of observing
a case of this kind. The care which the mother takes of her young
for two or three weeks, cannot be exceeded. She leads them gently in a
close flock in shallow waters, where, by diving, they procure food, and at
times, when the young are fatigued, and at some distance from the shore,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_347' href='#Page_347'>347</a></span>
she sinks her body in the water, and receives them on her back, where
they remain several minutes. At the approach of their merciless enemy,
the Black-backed Gull, the mother beats the water with her wings, as if
intending to raise the spray around her, and on her uttering a peculiar
sound, the young dive in all directions, while she endeavours to entice the
marauder to follow her, by feigning lameness, or she leaps out of the water
and attacks her enemy, often so vigorously, that, exhausted and disappointed,
he is glad to fly off, on which she alights near the rocks, among
which she expects to find her brood, and calls them to her side. Now
and then I saw two females which had formed an attachment to each other,
as if for the purpose of more effectually contributing to the safety of their
young, and it was very seldom that I saw these prudent mothers assailed
by the gull.
</p>

<p>
The young, at the age of one week, are of a dark mouse colour, thickly
covered with soft warm down. Their feet at this period are proportionally
very large and strong. By the 20th of July they seemed to be all
hatched. They grew rapidly, and when about a fortnight old were, with
great difficulty, obtained, unless during stormy weather, when they at
times retired from the sea to shelter themselves under the shelvings of the
rocks at the head of shallow bays. It is by no means difficult to rear
them, provided proper care be taken of them, and they soon become quite
gentle and attached to the place set apart for them. A fisherman of
Eastport, who carried eight or ten of them from Labrador, kept them
several years in a yard close to the water of the bay, to which, after they
were grown, they daily betook themselves, along with some common ducks,
regularly returning on shore towards evening. Several persons who had
seen them, assured me that they were as gentle as their associates, and although
not so active on land, were better swimmers, and moved more
gracefully on the water. They were kept until the male birds acquired
their perfect plumage and mated; but some gunners shot the greater
number of them one winter day, having taken them for wild birds, although
none of them could fly, they having been pinioned. I have no
doubt that if this valuable bird were domesticated, it would prove a great
acquisition, both on account of its feathers and down, and its flesh as an
article of food. I am persuaded that very little attention would be necessary
to effect this object. When in captivity, it feeds on different kinds
of grain and moistened corn-meal, and its flesh becomes excellent. Indeed,
the sterile females which we procured at Labrador in considerable number,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
tasted as well as the mallard. The males were tougher and more
fishy, so that we rarely ate of them, although the fishermen and settlers
paid no regard to sex in this matter.
</p>

<p>
When the female Eider is suddenly discovered on her nest, she takes
to wing at a single spring; but if she sees her enemy at some distance,
she walks off a few steps, and then flies away. If unseen by a person
coming near, as may often happen, when the nest is placed under the
boughs of the dwarf fir, she will remain on it, although she may hear
people talking. On such occasions my party frequently discovered the
nests by raising the pine branches, and were often as much startled as the
ducks themselves could be, as the latter instantly sprung past them on
wing, uttering a harsh cry. Now and then some were seen to alight on
the ground within fifteen or twenty yards, and walk as if lame and broken-winged,
crawling slowly away, to entice their enemies to go in pursuit.
Generally, however, they would fly to the sea, and remain there in
a large flock until their unwelcome visitors departed. When pursued by
a boat, with their brood around them, they allowed us to come up to
shooting distance, when, feigning decrepitude, they would fly off, beating
the water with partially extended wings, while the young either dived or
ran on the surface with wonderful speed, for forty or fifty yards, then
suddenly plunged, and seldom appeared at the surface unless for a moment.
The mothers always flew away as soon as their brood dispersed,
and then ended the chase. The cry or note of the female is a hoarse rolling
croak; that of the male I never heard.
</p>

<p>
Should the females be robbed of their eggs, they immediately go off
in search of mates, whether their previous ones or not I cannot tell, although
I am inclined to think so. However this may be, the duck in
such a case soon meets with a drake, and may be seen returning the same
day with him to her nest. They swim, fly, and walk side by side, and
by the end of ten or twelve days the male takes his leave, and rejoins
his companions out at sea, while the female is found sitting on a new set
of eggs, seldom, however, exceeding four. But this happens only at an
early period of the season, for I observed that as soon as the males had
begun to moult, the females, whose nests had been plundered, abandoned
the place. One of the most remarkable circumstances connected with
these birds is, that the females with broods are fully three weeks later
in moulting than the males, whereas those which do not breed begin
to moult as early as they. This may probably seem strange, but I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
became quite satisfied of the fact while at Labrador, where, from the
number which we procured in a state of change, and the vast quantities
every now and then in sight, our opportunities of observing these birds
in a perfectly natural state were ample.
</p>

<p>
Some authors have said that the males keep watch near the females;
but, although this may be the case in countries such as Greenland and
Iceland, where the Eiders have been trained into a state of semi-domestication,
it certainly was not so in Labrador. Not a single male did we
there see near the females after incubation had commenced, unless in the
case mentioned above, when the latter had been deprived of their eggs.
The males invariably kept aloof and in large flocks, sometimes of a hundred
or more individuals, remaining out at sea over large banks with
from seven to ten fathoms of water, and retiring at night to insular rocks.
It seemed very wonderful that in the long lines in which we saw them
travelling, we did not on any occasion discover among them a young
bird, or one not in its mature plumage. The young males, if they breed
before they acquire their full colouring, must either be by themselves at
this period, or with the barren females, which, as I have already said,
separate from those that are breeding. I am inclined to believe that
the old males commence their southward migration before the females
or the young, as none were to be seen for about a fortnight before the
latter started. In winter, when these Ducks are found on the Atlantic
shores of the United States, the males and females are intermingled; and
at the approach of spring the mated pairs travel in great flocks, though
disposed in lines, when you can distinctly see individuals of both sexes
alternating.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Eider is firm, strong, and generally steady. They
propel themselves by constant beats of the wings, undulating their lines
according to the inequality of surface produced by the waves, over which
they pass at the height of a few yards, and rarely more than a mile from
the shores. Few fly across the Gulf of St Lawrence, as they prefer following
the coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, to the eastern entrance
of the straits of Belle Isle, beyond which many proceed farther
north, while others ascend that channel and settle for the season along
the shores of Labrador, as far up as Partridge Bay, and still farther up
the St Lawrence. Whilst on our waters, or at their breeding grounds,
the Eiders are not unfrequently seen flying much higher than when
travelling, but in that case they seem to be acting with the intention of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
guarding against their enemy man. The velocity of their flight has
been ascertained to be about eighty miles in the hour.
</p>

<p>
This species dives with great agility, and can remain a considerable
time under water, often going down in search of food to the depth of
eight or ten fathoms, or even more. When wounded, however, they soon
become fatigued in consequence of the exertion used in diving, and may
be overtaken by a well-manned boat in the course of half an hour or so,
as when fatigued they swim just below the surface, and may be struck
dead with an oar or a boat-hook.
</p>

<p>
Their food consists principally of shell-fish, the shells of which they
seem to have the power of breaking into pieces. In many individuals
which I opened, I found the entrails almost filled with small fragments
of shells mixed with other matter. Crustaceous animals and their roe,
as well as that of various fishes, I also found in their stomach, along with
pebbles sometimes as large as a hazel nut. The œsophagus, which is in
form like a bag, and is of a leathery firm consistence, was often found
distended with food, and usually emitted a very disagreeable fishy odour.
The gizzard is extremely large and muscular. The trachea of the young
male, so long as it remains in its imperfect plumage, or for the first twelve
months, does not resemble that of the old male; but on this subject I
intend to speak at length on another occasion. The males do not obtain
their full plumage until the fourth winter. They at first resemble the
mother, then gradually become pie-bald, but not in less time than between
two and three years.
</p>

<p>
The Eider Duck takes a heavy shot, and is more easily killed on
wing than while swimming. When on shore they mark your approach
while you are yet at a good distance, and fly off before you come within
shot. Sometimes you may surprise them while swimming below high
rocks, and, if you are expert, then shoot them; but when they have first
seen you, it is seldom that you can procure them, as they dive with extreme
agility. While at Great Macatina Harbour, we discovered a large
basin of water, communicating with the sea by a very narrow passage
about thirty yards across, and observed that at particular stages of the
tides the Eider Ducks entered and returned by it. By hiding ourselves
on both sides of this channel, we succeeded in killing a good number, but
rarely more than one at a shot, although sometimes we obtained from a
single file as many as we had of gun-barrels.
</p>

<p>
Excepting in a single nest, I found no down clean, it having been in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' href='#Page_351'>351</a></span>
every other instance more or less mixed with small dry fir twigs and bits
of grass. When cleaned, the down of a nest rarely exceeds an ounce in
weight, although, from its great elasticity, it is so bulky as to fill a hat,
or if properly prepared even a larger space. The eggers of Labrador
usually collect it in considerable quantity, but at the same time make
such havock among the birds, that at no very distant period the traffic
must cease.

<h2>
THE VELVET DUCK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula fusca</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXLVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Velvet Duck arrives from the north along the shores of the Middle
States, about the first of September, and extends to a greater or less
distance southward, according to the state of the weather, often proceeding
as far as Georgia. The Bay of Chesapeake and all the estuaries to
the eastward are amply furnished with it, and there it is usually seen in
company with the American Scoter, the Golden-eyed Duck, and some
other species. It very rarely enters fresh waters during its stay on our
coast, and is with great propriety called a Sea Duck. My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas
Nuttall</span> mentions that some, which probably were young birds, had
been seen in Fresh Pond near Cambridge in Massachusetts. This is the
only case of the kind that I have heard of, although these birds breed in
fresh water lakes and in rivers, in which they remain at the season of reproduction
about two months.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning of April, the Velvet Ducks, which are gregarious,
collect in large flocks, for the purpose of removing to their northern
breeding places, and as they fly steadily onwards, you may see thousands
passing at short distances from the shores, and forming an almost continuous
line, each flock composed of twenty or thirty individuals, which
fly low and irregularly, ranged in an angular form. While on the Bay
of Fundy, I went with my party to a projecting cape, round which these
birds passed during our stay, from daylight until evening. When it
blows hard from the sea, the Ducks come near to the shore, and afford
abundant opportunities to such sportsmen as are fond of shooting them.
</p>

<p>
As we approached the shores of Labrador, we found the waters covered
with dense flocks of these birds, and yet they continued to arrive there
from the St Lawrence for several days in succession. We were all astonished
at their numbers, which were such that we could not help imagining
that all the Velvet Ducks in the world were passing before us.
This was about the middle of June, which I thought late for them, but
the season had been tardy, and the fishermen informed us, that when the
weather is warmer, these birds pass a fortnight earlier. The greater number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
merely appear for a few days on their way farther north, but some
remain to breed on the southern coast of Labrador. Thousands of sterile
individuals, however, spend the summer on the Bay of Fundy.
</p>

<p>
During the breeding season, the Velvet Duck resembles the Eider in
its habits, only that it prefers fresh water, which is rarely the case with
the other species. The males leave the females after incubation has commenced.
Those which breed at Labrador begin to form their nests from
the 1st to the 10th of June, and on the 28th of July I caught some young
ones several days old. The nests are placed within a few feet of the borders
of small lakes, a mile or two distant from the sea, and usually under
the low boughs of the bushes, of the twigs of which, with mosses and various
plants matted together, they are formed. They are large and almost
flat, several inches thick, with some feathers of the female, but no down,
under the eggs, which are usually six in number, intermediate in size between
those of the Eider and King Ducks, measuring an inch and three
quarters in length, one and seven-eighths in breadth, of a uniform pale
cream colour tinged with green, not pure white as stated by some authors.
On the 28th of July I procured five young ones out of a brood of six, among
which, although to appearance scarcely a week old, I could readily distinguish
the males from the females as they swam on the little pond
around their mother, the former having already a white spot under the eye.
The down with which they were covered was rather stiff and hair-like, of
a black colour, excepting under the chin, where there was a small patch
of white. They swam with great ease, and when we drove them into a
narrow place for the purpose of catching them, they several times turned
upon us and dived with the view of getting back to the middle of the
pond, so that at last we found it necessary to shoot them. Only one
escaped ashore, which my young friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Lincoln</span> caught, but
afterwards restored to its mother, which continued on the pond, manifesting
the greatest anxiety, and calling to her brood all the while with
short squeaking notes, by no means unpleasant to the ear. On being
shot at, she flew off to another pond, but soon returned. Her plumage
was rusty and ragged, but the wings seemed to be complete, as she flew
with great ease, springing at once from the water.
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span> of Bras d’Or assured me, that either that individual or another
of the same species, had bred on the same pond for six or seven
years in succession, and that he had looked at the nest and observed her
manners when leading about the young, which he said did not leave the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
pond until they were able to fly. That year, 1833, she and her mate
had arrived nearly a month later than usual. This accounted for the
small size of the young, which he was sorry to see dead; and here let me
say that Mr <span class="smcap">Jones</span>, who is not only a good-hearted and benevolent man,
but also fond of observing nature, was the first person I met with who could
give me any rational account of the ducks which bred in his vicinity.
</p>

<p>
A few of the Velvet Ducks breed on the Island of Grand Manan, and
in other places about the Bay of Fundy, but rarely farther south, and
the number that remain in Labrador is comparatively small, as we did
not observe there more than six or seven broods. They generally leave
that part of the coast about the middle of August; but that season they
were still seen after the Eider Ducks had departed, which makes me think
that they require more warmth than these birds before they begin to lay
their eggs. Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span>, of the British Royal Navy, a
gentleman, besides his professional merits, distinguished for his love of
science, informed me that none of these birds were observed on either of
his Arctic voyages. The extreme limits of their migrations remain unknown.
I have already related the manner in which this and several
other species are caught by the Indians in the Bay of Fundy, and therefore
it is unnecessary that I should repeat it here, as you will find it at
p. 487. of Vol. II.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Velvet Duck is strong and sustained, although it
usually flies low; yet when pursued, or at the sight of gunners in a boat,
it often rises to the height of forty or fifty yards, describes elegant curved
lines as it passes and repasses, and thus continues to fly until danger is no
longer apprehended. Its movements in the air are performed by continued
flappings, and when on wing the white of the wings is beautifully
contrasted with the dark hue of the rest of its plumage. It dives with as
much agility as the Eider or the American Scoter, and, when wounded,
is equally difficult to be caught, nor can it be killed with certainty without
a heavy shot.
</p>

<p>
The Velvet Ducks enter the bays and estuaries to a greater distance
than the Eiders. On land they move with more difficulty than those
birds, and keep themselves in a more erect attitude, like that in which I
have endeavoured to represent the male in the plate. They swim with
more buoyancy than the Eiders, but at times seem to rise from the water
with considerable difficulty. Their food consists of shell-fish and crustacea,
as well as sea-weeds, small fish, and spawn. Their flesh is extremely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' href='#Page_357'>357</a></span>
dark, tastes of fish, and is very unpalatable, although I have seen persons
of great judgment in matters of this kind not only eat it with avidity,
but praise it as highly as if it were equal to the most tender and juicy
venison. They are sold in abundance in our eastern markets and those
of the Middle States, at from fifty cents to a dollar the pair.
</p>

<p>
This species is, in my opinion, very closely allied to the Eider, in so
much that I frequently call it the Black King-Duck. Along our coasts
it commonly receives the name of White-winged Coot. The female is
smaller than the male. The young much resemble the female during the
first year. The white spots of the head, however, are apparent, although
mottled with dusky, and their feet now shew some of the redness of those
of the old males; but I am unable to say with certainty at what age they
attain their full summer plumage, and the rich colouring of the bill. The
Gizzard, which is not so large as that of the Eider, is of a yellow colour;
the gut very large, tough, and strong, about eight feet in length.

THE PIED-BILLED DOBCHICK.

<p>
There go the little Dobchicks, among the tall rashes and aquatic
grasses that border the marsh. They have seen me, and now I watch
them as they sink gently backwards into the deep water, in the manner
of frightened frogs. Cunning things! “Water-witches,” as they call
you, I clearly see your bills, although you have withdrawn all of you
save those parts, and sneak off towards yon great bunch of bulrushes.
Well, speed on, and may safety attend you! Nature has granted you
means of eluding your enemies, and I am heartily glad to see that you
have profited by her instructions. I know you can fly too. How happy
must you be, to be thus enabled to migrate through the air, instead of
being obliged to labour for months with your curiously scolloped feet, in
removing from one country to another, as <i>authors</i> say you do. Ah! you
have reached a small secluded pool, where you intend to breed in peace
and security; there you are, collecting rushes and weeds to form a large
matted bed, on which you intend to deposit your pearly eggs. Labour
on, mind me not, I am a true friend and admirer of your race. I see that
among these plants you have fixed your tenement, in which there will
soon be five eggs, which, although tinged with green, will look as if pure
white. I wish I knew how many days of constant heat from your bodies
it will require to hatch them. Some other time perhaps you may tell me.
Miniatures of yourselves I now see swimming gaily, skipping, springing,
gliding, dipping, just like yourselves. So, you snatch the crawling bug,
and gorge yourselves with leeches, fish, and herbage. How fast your
young ones grow, changing from downy to hairy, and again to feathery
and silky. On winglets they now cross the clear pool, and crawl on the
opposite shore, there enjoying the warmth of the bright sunbeams. September
has come; plump and strong seven of you there are; the evening
is calm and beautiful; you spread out your wings, reach with some
difficulty a proper height, and swift as meteors glide through the air, until,
meeting with warmer waters, you alight on them, and there remain
for a season.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' href='#Page_360'>360</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Pied-billed Dobchick may be met with in almost every part of the
United States, at one season or other: in the south and west during autumn
and winter, in the east and north-west in spring and summer, mostly
on fresh waters of all descriptions, yet when these are covered with ice,
on bays and estuaries, where it searches for shrimps and fry, although under
other circumstances such haunts are not congenial to it. It is found
in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but I did not meet with it in Labrador
or Newfoundland.
</p>

<p>
I had the good fortune, on the 28th of June, to stumble upon a nest
of this bird near the banks of the Wabash river, above Vincennes. It
was large for the bird, raised several inches above the muddy and reedy
shores of a pond, only a few feet from the water, and composed of decayed
weeds, rushes, and earth. On being discovered, the sitting bird
slid over the mud, along a path that led directly to the water, in which it
immediately dived, and I saw no more of it for about twenty minutes.
The eggs, which were five, measured an inch and a quarter, by seven and a
half-eighths, were smooth, rather rounded, and of a light greenish-white
colour. On breaking one of them, I found it to contain a chick considerably
advanced, which induced me to leave the rest untouched, and before I
departed I saw the bird, which I believed to be the female, swimming low
at a distance. I watched it for some time, but could not discover another,
and walked away to allow it to resume its occupation. The nest was fixed
among the stalks of strong reeds, but was not attached to any of them.
In the month of August, while on the Cayuga lakes, I saw one of these
birds with a brood of young about half grown, but could not obtain a
single specimen, as they dived with extreme quickness, and eluded all
pursuit.
</p>

<p>
Few birds plunge with more rapidity than this species, which, during
submersion, employs its wings, as I had an opportunity of observing while
some were passing under a boat when I was in pursuit of them. On the
water it is almost impossible to catch them, unless they have been injured in
the wing, when they are unable to dive without difficulty. The curious
habit which they have of sinking gradually backward in the water, at the
sight of an enemy, is very pleasing to observe. Not a ripple do they
leave on the spot where they have disappeared, and one unacquainted
with them can hardly conceive that a bird could have escaped in so dexterous
a manner. My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas MacCulloch</span> gave me an account
of one which, having been observed on a small mill-dam, was pursued by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>361</a></span>
the miller’s sons, who, after chasing it fully an hour, could not even drive
it on shore. Their father, however, who was as anxious as themselves to
see the curious creature, drained the pond, when the little thing was seen
crawling over the mud in a manner not unlike that of a turtle. It was
now easily caught, as it was not able to rise on wing, the species, it seems,
being incapable of springing from the ground, and was afterwards given
to my young friend, who presented it beautifully prepared to me.
</p>

<p>
While I was at Philadelphia, my learned and staunch friend Dr
<span class="smcap">Richard Harlan</span>, received two Pied-billed Grebes alive, which had been
caught in a fishing-net on Brandy wine Creek. We placed them in a large
tub of water, where we could see all their subaqueous movements. They
swam round the sides of the tub in the manner of the Puffin, moving
their wings in accordance with their feet, and continued so a much longer
time than one could suppose it possible for them to remain under water,
coming up to breathe, and plunging again with astonishing celerity.
When placed on the carpet, they ran awkwardly half erect, for a distance
of a few feet, tumbled over, and scrambled along with the aid of their
wings. Nothing could induce them to eat, and after a day or two of captivity,
the little creatures were taken to the Delaware, and set at liberty.
</p>

<p>
This bird retires to rest on the floating beds of rushes met with in ponds,
or on the edges of the shores; and in such places you may see it sitting upright,
and dressing its plumage in the sunshine. They are extremely unwilling
to rise on wing, unless during their migrations, or when chasing
each other at the pairing season, which commences in March, when they
manifest a good deal of pugnacity. On such occasions, the males fly, dive,
and rise again on wing, in the manner of the Foolish Guillemot. While
travelling, they pass rapidly through the air, at times at a considerable elevation,
when the movements of their wings produce a sound like that of a
hawk stooping on its prey. They are seldom found in parties of more
than six or seven. The idea of their migrating by water is quite absurd.
How long would it take a Dobchick to swim from the mouths of the Mississippi
to the head waters of the Ohio; and when arrived there, after
six or seven weeks of constant paddling, how is he to proceed farther?
Yet it is well known that they breed farther north, and are general on
the southern waters early in October.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Pied-billed Dobchick consists of small fry, plants, seeds,
aquatic insects, and snails; along with which they swallow gravel. On
opening several individuals, in different parts of the Union, I observed in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
their gizzards a quantity of hair and feather-like substance, for which I
could not account, but which I at length found to be the down of certain
plants, such as thistles, the seeds remaining undigested and attached to it.
My friend <span class="smcap">Thomas MacCulloch</span> made the same observation on examining
some at Pictou in Nova Scotia, and I have found similar substances in
the stomach of many individuals of <i>Podiceps cristatus</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Pied-billed Bobchicks seem to form particular attachments to certain
ponds or small lakes, where, until they are closed by ice, you may
always observe a pair or a family. Opposite Henderson I regularly saw
a couple every autumn, and my friend the Reverend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has
observed a group of them for many winters in a small pond a few miles
distant from Charleston. They seem to have a dislike to swift-running
streams, and when on them keep to the eddies along the shores. The
curious double pectination on the hind part of their tarsi, seems to aid
them greatly while sitting upright on the broad leaves of water-lilies, on
the surface of which I have observed indented impressions after the birds
had plunged into the water from them. The young differ in colour from
the adult, but the old males and females resemble each other, only the
former are larger.

The specimen from which I drew the figure of this singular looking
bird, was procured at the mouth of the Kennebeck River, in Maine. It
was shot by a fisherman gunner, while standing on some floating ice, in
the winter of 1831-32. No other individual was seen. I could not obtain
any information respecting its habits; but as the bird was in tolerable
order, I hope that my figures of it will prove not unacceptable. It was a
male, and appeared to be adult. My friend, the Prince of Musignano,
mentions this species as being an inhabitant of the seas between North
America and Kamtschatka, being, he adds, often found on the western
coasts of the United States in winter.

THE ARCTIC TERN.

<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna Arctica</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCL. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Light as a sylph, the Arctic Tern dances through the air above and
around you. The graces, one might imagine, had taught it to perform
those beautiful gambols which you see it display the moment you approach
the spot which it has chosen for its nest. Over many a league of
ocean has it passed, regardless of the dangers and difficulties that might
deter a more considerate traveller. Now over some solitary green isle,
a creek or an extensive bay, it sweeps, now over the expanse of the
boundless sea; at length it has reached the distant regions of the north,
and amidst the floating icebergs stoops to pick up a shrimp. It betakes
itself to the borders of a lonely sand-bank, or a low rocky island; there
side by side the males and the females alight, and congratulate each other
on the happy termination of their long journey. Little care is required
to form a cradle for their progeny; in a short time the variegated eggs
are deposited, the little Terns soon burst the shell, and in a few days
hobble towards the edge of the water, as if to save their fond parents
trouble; feathers now sprout on their wings, and gradually invest their
whole body; the young birds at length rise on wing, and follow their
friends to sea. But now the brief summer of the north is ended, dark
clouds obscure the sun, a snow-storm advances from the polar lands, and
before it skim the buoyant Terns, rejoicing at the prospect of returning
to the southern regions.
</p>

<p>
The day after our arrival at the Magdaleine Islands, the weather was
beautiful, although a stiff breeze blew from the south-west. I landed
with my party at an early hour, and we felt as if at a half-way house
on our journey from Nova Scotia to Labrador. Some of us ascended the
more elevated parts of those interesting islands, while others walked along
the shores. A clean sand-beach lay before us, and we proceeded over
it, until having reached a kind of peninsula, we were brought to a stand.
The Piping Plover ran and flew swiftly before us, emitting its soft and
mellow notes, while some dozens of Arctic Terns were plunging into
the waters, capturing a tiny fish or shrimp at every dash. Until that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
moment this Tern had not been familiar to me, and as I admired its easy
and graceful motions, I felt agitated with a desire to possess it. Our
guns were accordingly charged with mustard-seed shot, and one after
another you might have seen the gentle birds come whirling down upon
the waters. But previous to this I had marked their mode of flight, their
manner of procuring their prey, and their notes, that I might be able to
finish the picture from life. Alas, poor things! how well do I remember
the pain it gave me, to be thus obliged to pass and execute sentence
upon them. At that very moment I thought of those long-past times,
when individuals of my own species were similarly treated; but I excused
myself with the plea of necessity, as I recharged my double gun. As
soon as a sufficient number of males and females lay dead at our feet, we
retired from the water’s edge, to watch the motions of the survivors,
among whom confusion and dismay prevailed, as they dashed close over
our heads, and vociferated their maledictions. We did not, however, depart
until we had tried a curious experiment for the third time. A female
had been shot, and lay dead on the water for a considerable while. Her
mate, whom I was unwilling to destroy, alighted upon her, and attempted
to caress her, as if she had been alive. The same circumstance took
place three different times, on our throwing the dead bird on the water.
Something of the same nature I have related in my article on the Wild
Turkey. All this happened in the month of June 1833, when none of
the Arctic Terns had yet produced eggs, although we found them nearly
ready to lay, as were the Piping Plovers.
</p>

<p>
Our schooner now sailed onward, and carried us to the dreary shores
of Labrador. There, after some search, we met with a great flock of
Arctic Terns breeding on a small island slightly elevated above the sea.
Myriads of these birds were there sitting on their eggs. The individuals
were older than those which we had seen on the Magdeleine Islands; for
the more advanced in life the individuals of any species are, the more
anxious are they to reproduce, the sooner do they proceed to their summer
residence, and the more extensive is the range of their migration northward.
On the other hand, the younger the bird is, the farther south it
removes during winter, both because it thus enjoys a milder climate, and
requires less exertion in procuring its food; whereas the older individuals
not only have a stronger constitution, but are more expert in discovering
and securing their prey, so that it is not necessary for them to extend
their journey so far.

<p>
The Arctic Tern is found with us on the eastern coasts of the United
States only, where it appears, from the shores of New Jersey northwards,
in autumn, and whence it departs in early spring. No sooner have the
winter tempests subsided, than it is observed gliding along the coast, together
with many other birds. In the beginning of March, you see it
following the sinuosities of the shores, some passing directly from the
Sable Islands off the Bay of Fundy and Newfoundland into Baffin’s Bay;
others, younger, and unwilling to encounter the perils of a more extended
flight, passing up the Gulf of St Lawrence, either through the Straits of
Cansso, or the broader channel between Cape Breton and Newfoundland,
and betaking themselves to the Magdaleine Islands and the coasts of
Labrador.
</p>

<p>
While at American Harbour in June 1833, my son and some of his
companions met with a low rocky island, on which hundreds of these
Terns had deposited their eggs. No other species was seen there; the
birds were mostly sitting, and, on the landing of the party, they all rose
as if in the greatest consternation, hovered over their heads, and left their
eggs to the mercy of the intruders who carried off a basketful of them,
with a few of the birds themselves.
</p>

<p>
On the 18th of the same month, the Arctic Terns were found breeding
on another island in considerable numbers; many dozens of their eggs
were gathered, and delicious food indeed they proved to be. The full
number of their eggs is three, but as it was early in the season many had
only two. Their average dimensions were an inch and a quarter in
length, and five-eighths in their greatest breadth; they were oval, but
rather sharp at the smaller ends; their ground-colour a light-olive, irregularly
covered with patches of dark umber, larger towards the round
end. They were deposited on the rocks wherever there was any grass,
but no nest had been formed for their reception. They differed extremely
in their colour, indeed quite as much as those of the Sandwich Tern.
As we approached the little island, they all rose in the air, and flew high
over our heads, screaming loudly, which they continued to do until we
left the place. Several were shot, and as each fell the rest immediately
plunged through the air after it. Whenever one was wounded so slightly
as to be able to make off, it was lost to us, and the rest followed it.
Only a very few of those which we saw and shot had the bill entirely red,
and those which had were evidently older birds. Some exhibited a considerable
portion of the point tinged with brownish-black, yet all of them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
could easily be distinguished from the <i>Sterna Hirundo</i>, first by their
smaller size, shorter tarsi, more delicate bill, and greater curvature of the
outer part of their wings; and secondly, by the leaden tint of their lower
parts, from the neck to the tail, those parts in <i>Sterna Hirundo</i> being
pure white. The back is also of a deeper blue in the Arctic Tern.
The long tail-feathers were much shorter in the females than in the males,
but <span class="smcap">M. Temminck</span> is wrong in saying that this bird has the tail proportionally
longer than that of other species, the Roseate Tern having it of
much greater length, considering its diminutive size.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the first autumn, the plumage of the young so much
resembles that of the young of <i>Sterna Hirundo</i>, that a person, not paying
attention to the tarsi and feet, might readily confound them together. Yet
even at this early age, there are strong indications of the bluish tint on the
under parts. The longest tail-feathers at this period do not extend more
than two inches beyond the rest; the upper parts of the body are mottled
with brown, as in all the other species, and in Gulls. The mantle of this, as
of all other Terns, assumes its permanent hue before any part of the wings.
On the 5th of August, in Labrador, the young birds were gambolling
along with their parents, over the shores of Bras d’Or Harbour, and when
we left that country the Terns still remained, so that I am unable to
state at what particular period they commence their journey southward.
</p>

<p>
The notes of this species resemble the syllables <i>creek</i>, <i>creek</i>, and are
often repeated while the bird is on wing. During autumn it follows
the sinuosities of the shores of the bays and inlets, ascending against the
ebb, and, returning to meet the tide, which enables it to procure its food
in succession while it keeps on its course. I have only farther to mention
a curious fact, which is, that all the Terns which breed in the northern
parts of the United States, and in regions still nearer the pole, sit closely
on their eggs, while the small species that breed to the southward incubate
only during night, or in rainy weather.

<h2>
A TOUGH WALK FOR A YOUTH.
</h2>

<p>
About twelve years ago I was conveyed, along with my son <span class="smcap">Victor</span>,
from Bayou Sarah to the mouth of the Ohio, on board the steamer Magnet,
commanded by Mr <span class="smcap">M’Knight</span>, to whom I here again offer my best
thanks for his attentions. The very sight of the waters of that beautiful
river filled me with joy as we approached the little village of Trinity,
where we were landed along with several other passengers, the water being
too low to enable the vessel to proceed to Louisville. No horses could
be procured, and as I was anxious to continue my journey without delay,
I consigned my effects to the care of the tavern-keeper, who engaged to
have them forwarded by the first opportunity. My son, who was not
fourteen, with all the ardour of youth, considered himself able to accomplish
on foot the long journey which we contemplated. Two of the passengers
evinced a desire to accompany us, “provided,” said the tallest and
stoutest of them, “the lad can keep up. My business,” he continued,
“is urgent, and I shall push for Frankfort pretty fast.” Dinner, to
which we had contributed some fish from the river, being over, my boy
and I took a ramble along the shores of Cash Creek, on which some years
before I had been detained several weeks by ice. We slept at the tavern,
and next morning prepared for our journey, and were joined by our companions,
although it was past twelve before we crossed the creek.
</p>

<p>
One of our fellow-travellers, named <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, who was a delicate and
gentlemanly person, acknowledged that he was not a good walker, and
said he was glad that my son was with us, as he might be able to keep up
with the lively youth. The other, a burly personage, at once pushed forward.
We walked in Indian file along the narrow track cut through the
canes, passed a wood-yard, and entered the burnt forest, in which we met
with so many logs and briars, that we judged it better to make for the
river, the course of which we followed over a bed of pebbles, my son sometimes
a-head, and again falling back, until we reached America, a village
having a fine situation, but with a shallow approach to the shore. Here
we halted at the best house, as every traveller ought to do, whether pedestrian
or equestrian, for he is there sure of being well treated, and will not
have more to pay than in an inferior place. Now we constituted Mr <span class="smcap">Rose</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
purser. We had walked twelve miles over rugged paths and pebbly
shores, and soon proceeded along the edge of the river. Seven tough
miles ended, we found a house near the bank, and in it we determined to
pass the night. The first person we met with was a woman picking cotton
in a small field. On asking her if we might stay in her cabin for the
night, she answered we might, and hoped we could make a shift with the
fare on which she and her husband lived. While she went to the house
to prepare supper, I took my son and Mr <span class="smcap">Rose</span> to the water, knowing
how much we should be refreshed by a bath. Our fellow-traveller refused,
and stretched himself on a bench by the door. The sun was setting;
thousands of robins were flying southward in the calm and clear
air; the Ohio was spread before us smooth as a mirror, and into its waters
we leaped with pleasure. In a short time the goodman of the hut
called us to supper, and in a trice we were at his heels. He was a tall
raw-boned fellow, with an honest bronzed face. After our frugal meal,
we all four lay down in a large bed spread on the floor, while the good
people went up to a loft.
</p>

<p>
The woodsman having, agreeably to our instructions, roused us at
day-break, told us that about seven miles farther we should meet with a
breakfast much better than the last supper we had. He refused any pecuniary
compensation, but accepted from me a knife. So we again started.
My dear boy appeared very weak at first, but soon recovered, and our
stout companion, whom I shall call S., evidently shewed symptoms of
lassitude. On arriving at the cabin of a lazy man blessed with an industrious
wife and six healthy children, all of whom laboured for his support,
we were welcomed by the woman, whose motions and language indicated
her right to belong to a much higher class. Better breakfast I never ate:
the bread was made of new corn ground on a tin-grater by the beautiful
hands of our blue-eyed hostess; the chickens had been prepared by one
of her lovely daughters; some good coffee was added, and my son had
fresh milk. The good woman, who now held a babe to her bosom, seemed
pleased to see how heartily we all ate; the children went to work, and the
lazy husband went to the door to smoke a corn-cob pipe. A dollar was
put into the ruddy hand of the chubby urchin, and we bade its mother
farewell. Again we trudged along the beach, but after a while betook
ourselves to the woods. My son became faint. Dear boy! never can I
forget how he lay exhausted on a log, large tears rolling down his cheeks.
I bathed his temples, spoke soothingly to him, and chancing to see a fine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
turkey cock run close by, directed his attention to it, when, as if suddenly
refreshed, he got up and ran a few yards towards the bird. From that
moment he seemed to acquire new vigour, and at length we reached Wilcox’s,
where we stopped for the night. We were reluctantly received at
the house, and had little attention paid to us, but we had a meal and went
to bed.
</p>

<p>
The sun rose in all its splendour, and the Ohio reflected its ruddy beams.
A finer view of that river can scarcely be obtained than that from the
house which we were leaving. Two miles through intricate woods brought
us to Belgrade, and having passed Fort Massacre, we halted and took
breakfast. S. gave us to understand that the want of roads made travelling
very unpleasant; he was not, he added, in the habit of “skulking
through the bushes or tramping over stony bars in the full sunshine,”
but how else he had travelled was not explained. Mr <span class="smcap">Rose</span> kept up
about as well as <span class="smcap">Victor</span>, and I now led the way. Towards sunset we
reached the shores of the river, opposite the mouth of the Cumberland.
On a hill, the property of a Major B., we found a house, and a solitary
woman, wretchedly poor, but very kind. She assured us, that if we
could not cross the river, she would give us food and shelter for the night,
but said that as the moon was up, she could get us put over when her
skiff came back. Hungry and fatigued we laid us down on the brown
grass, waiting either a scanty meal, or the skiff that was to convey us
across the river. I had already grated the corn for our supper, run down
the chickens, and made a fire, when a cry of “Boat coming” roused us
all. We crossed half of the Ohio, walked over Cumberland Isle, and
after a short ferry found ourselves in Kentucky, the native land of my
beloved sons. I was now within a few miles of the spot where, some
years before, I had a horse killed under me by lightning.
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary to detain you with a long narrative, and state every
occurrence until we reached the banks of Green River. We had left
Trinity at 12 o’clock of the 15th October, and on the morning of the
18th four travellers descending a hill, were admiring the reflection of the
sun’s rays on the forest-margined horizon. The frost which lay thick
on the ground and the fences, glittered in the sheen, and dissolved away;
all nature seemed beautiful in its calm repose; but the pleasure which I
felt on gazing on the scene was damped by the fatigue of my son, who
now limped like a lamed turkey, although, as the rest of the party were
not much better off, he smiled, straightened himself, and strove to keep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
up with us. Poor S. was panting many yards behind, and was talking
of purchasing a horse. We had now, however, a tolerably good road, and
in the evening got to a house where I inquired if we could have a supper
and beds. When I came out, <span class="smcap">Victor</span> was asleep on the grass, Mr <span class="smcap">Rose</span>
looking at his sore toes, and S. just finishing a jug of monongahela.
Here we resolved that, instead of going by Henderson, we should take a
cut across to the right, and make direct for Smith’s Ferry, by way of
Highland Lick Creek.
</p>

<p>
Next day we trudged along, but nothing very remarkable occurred
excepting that we saw a fine black wolf quite tame and gentle, the owner
of which had refused a hundred dollars for it. Mr <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, who was an
engineer, and a man of taste, amused us with his flageolet, and frequently
spoke of his wife, his children, and his fireside, which increased my
good opinion of him. At an orchard we filled our pockets with October
peaches, and when we came to Trade Water River we found it quite low.
The acorns were already drifted on its shallows, and the Wood Ducks
were running about picking them up. Passing a flat bottom, we saw a
large Buffalo Lick. Where now are the bulls which erst scraped its
earth away, bellowing forth their love or their anger?
</p>

<p>
Good Mr <span class="smcap">Rose</span>’s feet became sorer and sorer each succeeding day;
Mr S. at length nearly gave up; my son had grown brisker. The 20th
was cloudy, and we dreaded rain, as we knew the country to be flat and
clayey. In Union County, we came to a large opening, and found the
house of a Justice, who led us kindly to the main road, and accompanied
us for a mile, giving us excellent descriptions of brooks, woods and barrens,
notwithstanding which we should have been much puzzled, had not a
neighbour on horseback engaged to shew us the way. The rain now fell
in torrents, and rendered us very uncomfortable, but at length we reached
Highland Lick, where we stumbled on a cabin, the door of which we
thrust open, overturning a chair that had been placed behind it. On a
dirty bed lay a man, a table with a journal or perhaps a ledger before him,
a small cask in a corner near him, a brass pistol on a nail over his head,
and a long Spanish dagger by his side. He rose and asked what was
wanted. “The way to a better place, the road to <span class="smcap">Suggs</span>’s.” “Follow the
road, and you’ll get to his house in about five miles!” My party were
waiting for me, warming themselves by the fires of the salt-kettles. The
being I had seen was an overseer. By-and-by we crossed a creek; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
country was hilly, clayey and slippery; Mr S. was cursing, <span class="smcap">Rose</span> limped
like a lame duck, but <span class="smcap">Victor</span> kept up like a veteran.
</p>

<p>
Another day, kind Reader, and I shall for a while shut my journal.
The morning of the 21st was beautiful; we had slept comfortably at
<span class="smcap">Suggs</span>’s, and we soon found ourselves on pleasant barrens, with an agreeable
road. <span class="smcap">Rose</span> and S. were so nearly knocked up, that they proposed
to us to go on without them. We halted and talked a few minutes on
the subject, when our companions stated their resolution to proceed at a
slower pace. So we bade them adieu. I asked my son how he felt; he
laughed and quickened his steps; and in a short time our former associates
were left out of sight. In about two hours we were seated in the
Green River ferry-boat, with our legs hanging in the water. At Smith’s
Ferry this stream looks like a deep lake; and the thick cane on its banks,
the large overhanging willows, and its dark green waters, never fail to
form a fine picture, more especially in the calm of an autumnal evening.
Mr <span class="smcap">Smith</span> gave us a good supper, sparkling cider, and a comfortable bed.
It was arranged that he should drive us to Louisville in his dearborne;
and so here ended our walk of two hundred and fifty miles. Should you
wish to accompany us during the remainder of our journey, I have only
to refer you to the article “Hospitality in the Woods,” which you will
find in a former volume.

<h2>
THE BROWN PELICAN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Pelecanus fuscus</i>, Linn</span>.
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLI. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Brown Pelican, which is one of the most interesting of our American
birds, is a constant resident in the Floridas, where it resorts to the
Keys and the salt-water inlets, but never enters fresh-water streams, as the
White Pelican is wont to do. It is rarely seen farther eastward than
Cape Hatteras, but is found to the south far beyond the limits of the
United States. Within the recollection of persons still living, its numbers
have been considerably reduced, so much indeed that in the inner Bay
of Charleston, where twenty or thirty years ago it was quite abundant,
very few individuals are now seen, and these chiefly during a continuance
of tempestuous weather. There is a naked bar, a few miles distant from
the main land, between Charleston and the mouth of the Santee, on which
my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> some years ago saw a great number of these
birds, of which he procured several; but at the present day, few are
known to breed farther east than the salt-water inlets running parallel to
the coast of Florida, forty or fifty miles south of St Augustine, where I
for the first time met with this Pelican in considerable numbers.
</p>

<p>
My friend <span class="smcap">John Bullow</span>, Esq. took me in his barge to visit the Halifax,
which is a large inlet, and on which we soon reached an island
where the Brown Pelicans had bred for a number of years, but where, to
my great disappointment, none were then to be seen. The next morning,
being ten or twelve miles farther down the stream, we entered another inlet,
where I saw several dozens of these birds perched on the mangroves,
and apparently sound asleep. I shot at them from a very short distance,
and with my first barrel brought two to the water, but although many of
them still remained looking at us, I could not send the contents of my
second barrel to them, as the shot had unluckily been introduced into it
before the powder. They all flew off one after another, and still worse,
as the servants approached those which had fallen upon the water, they
also flew away.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at the Keys of Florida, on board the Marion Revenue
Cutter, I found the Pelicans pretty numerous. They became more abundant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
the farther south we proceeded, and I procured specimens at different
places, but nowhere so many as at Key West. There you would
see them flying within pistol-shot of the wharfs, the boys frequently trying
to knock them down with stones, although I believe they rarely succeed
in their efforts. The Marion lay at anchor several days at a short
distance from this island, and close to another. Scarcely an hour of
daylight passed without our having Pelicans around us, all engaged at
their ordinary occupations, some fishing, some slumbering as it were on
the bosom of the ocean, or on the branches of the mangroves. This
place and all around for about forty miles, seemed to be favourite resorts
of these birds; and as I had excellent opportunities of observing their
habits, I consider myself qualified to present you with some account of
them.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Brown Pelican, though to appearance heavy, is remarkably
well sustained, that bird being able not only to remain many
hours at a time on wing, but also to mount to a great height in the air to
perform its beautiful evolutions. Their ordinary manner of proceeding,
either when single or in flocks, is by easy flappings and sailings alternating
at distances of from twenty to thirty yards, when they glide along
with great speed. They move in an undulated line, passing at one time
high, at another low, over the water or land, for they do not deviate from
their course on coming upon a key or a point of land. When the waves
run high, you may see them “troughing,” as the sailors say, or directing
their course along the hollows. While on wing they draw in their head
between their shoulders, stretch out their broad webbed feet to their whole
extent, and proceed in perfect silence.
</p>

<p>
When the weather is calm, and a flood of light and heat is poured
down upon nature by the genial sun, they are often, especially during
the love season, seen rising in broad circles, flock after flock, until they
attain a height of perhaps a mile, when they gracefully glide on constantly
expanded wings, and course round each other, for an hour or
more at a time, after which, in curious zigzags, and with remarkable velocity,
they descend towards their beloved element, and settle on the
water, on large sand-bars or on mangroves. It is interesting beyond description
to observe flocks of Brown Pelicans thus going through their
aërial evolutions.
</p>

<p>
Now, Reader, look at those birds standing on their strong column-like
legs, on that burning sand-bar. How dexterously do they wield that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
great bill of theirs, as they trim their plumage! Now along each broad
quill it passes, drawing it out and displaying its elasticity; and now with
necks stretched to their full length, and heads elevated, they direct its
point in search of the insects that are concealed along their necks and
breasts. Now they droop their wings for a while, or stretch them alternately
to their full extent; some slowly lie down on the sand, others
remain standing, quietly draw their head over their broad shoulders,
raise one of their feet, and placing their bill on their back, compose themselves
to rest. There let them repose in peace. Had they alighted on
the waters, you might have seen them, like a fleet at anchor, riding on
the ever-rolling billows as unconcernedly as if on shore. Had they
perched on yon mangroves, they would have laid themselves flat on the
branches, or spread their wings to the sun or the breeze, as Vultures are
wont to do.
</p>

<p>
But see, the tide is advancing; the billows chase each other towards
the shores; the mullets joyful and keen leap along the surface, as they
fill the bays with their multitudes. The slumbers of the Pelicans are
over; the drowsy birds shake their heads, stretch open their mandibles
and pouch by way of yawning, expand their ample wings, and simultaneously
soar away. Look at them as they fly over the bay; listen to the
sound of the splash they make as they drive their open bills, like a pock-net,
into the sea, to scoop up their prey; mark how they follow that
shoal of porpoises, and snatch up the frightened fishes that strive to escape
from them. Down they go, again and again. What voracious creatures
they are!
</p>

<p>
The Brown Pelicans are as well aware of the time of each return of
the tide, as the most watchful pilots. Though but a short time before
they have been sound asleep, yet without bell or other warning, they
suddenly open their eyelids, and all leave their roosts, the instant when
the waters, which have themselves reposed for a while, resume their motion.
The Pelicans possess a knowledge beyond this, and in a degree
much surpassing that of man with reference to the same subject: they
can judge with certainty of the changes of weather. Should you see
them fishing all together, in retired bays, be assured, that a storm will
burst forth that day; but if they pursue their finny prey far out at sea,
the weather will be fine, and you also may launch your bark and go to
the fishing. Indeed, most sea-birds possess the same kind of knowledge,
as I have assured myself by repeated observation, in a degree corresponding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' href='#Page_379'>379</a></span>
to their necessities; and the best of all prognosticators of the weather,
are the Wild Goose, the Gannet, the Lestris, and the Pelican.
</p>

<p>
This species procures its food on wing, and in a manner quite different
from that of the White Pelican. A flock will leave their resting
place, proceed over the waters in search of fish, and when a shoal is perceived,
separate at once, when each, from an elevation of from fifteen to
twenty-five feet, plunges in an oblique and somewhat winding direction,
spreading to the full stretch its lower mandible and pouch, as it reaches
the water, and suddenly scoops up the object of its pursuit, immersing
the head and neck, and sometimes the body, for an instant. It immediately
swallows its prey, rises on wing, dashes on another fish, seizes
and devours it, and thus continues, sometimes plunging eight or ten
times in a few minutes, and always with unerring aim. When gorged,
it rests on the water for a while, but if it has a brood, or a mate sitting
on her eggs, it flies off at once towards them, no matter how heavily
laden it may be. The generally received idea that Pelicans keep fish or
water in their pouch, to convey them to their young, is quite erroneous.
The water which enters the pouch when it is immersed, is immediately
forced out between the partially closed mandibles, and the fish, unless
larger than those on which they usually feed, is instantly swallowed, to
be afterwards disgorged for the benefit of the young, either partially
macerated, or whole, according to the age and size of the latter. Of
all this I have satisfied myself, when within less than twenty yards of
the birds as they were fishing; and I never saw them fly without the
pouch being closely contracted towards the lower mandible. Indeed, although
I now much regret that I did not make the experiment when I
had the means of doing so, I doubt very much if a Pelican could fly at
all with its burden so much out of trim, as a sailor would say.
</p>

<p>
They at times follow the porpoise, when that animal is in pursuit of
prey, and as the fishes rise from the deep water towards the surface, come
in cunningly for their share, falling upon the frightened shoal, and seizing
one or more, which they instantly gobble up. But one of the most curious
traits of the Pelican is, that it acts unwittingly as a sort of purveyor
to the Gulls just as the Porpoise acts towards itself. The Black-headed
Gull of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, which is abundant along the coast of the Floridas in
spring and summer, watches the motions of the Pelicans. The latter
having plunged after a shoal of small fishes, of which it has caught a
number at a time, in letting off the water from amongst them, sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
allows a few to escape; but the Gull at that instant alights on the bill
of the Pelican, or on its head, and seizes the fry at the moment they were
perhaps congratulating themselves on their escape. This every body
on board the Marion observed as well as myself, while that vessel was
at anchor in the beautiful harbour of Key West, so that it is not again
necessary for me to lay before you a certificate with numerous signatures.
To me such sights were always highly interesting, and I doubt
if in the course of my endeavours to amuse you, I ever felt greater pleasure
than I do at this moment, when, with my journal at my side, and
the Gulls and Pelicans in my mind’s eye as distinctly as I could wish, I
ponder on the faculties which Nature has bestowed on animals which we
merely consider as possessed of instinct. How little do we yet know of
the operations of the Divine Power! On the occasions just mentioned,
the Pelicans did not manifest the least anger towards the Gulls. It is
said that the Frigate Pelican or Man-of-war Bird, forces the Brown Pelican
to disgorge its food, but of this I never saw an instance; nor do I
believe it to be the case, considering the great strength and powerful bill
of the Pelican compared with those of the other bird. Indeed, if I had
been told that when the Frigate Bird assails the Pelican, the latter opens
its large pouch and swallows it entire, I might as soon have believed the
one story as the other. But of this more anon, when we come to the
habits of the bird in question.
</p>

<p>
On the ground this species is by no means so active, for it walks
heavily, and when running, which it now and then does while in play, or
during courtship, it looks extremely awkward, as it then stretches out its
neck, partially extends its wings, and reels so that one might imagine it
ready to fall at each step. If approached when wounded and on the
water, it swims off with speed, and when overtaken, it suddenly turns
about, opens its large bill, snaps it violently several times in succession,
causing it to emit a smart noise in the manner of owls, strikes at you, and
bites very severely. While I was at Mr <span class="smcap">Bullow</span>’s, his Negro hunter waded
after one whose wing had been broken. The Pelican could not be seized
without danger, and I was surprised to see the hunter draw his butcher’s
knife, strike the long blade through the open pouch of the bird, hook it,
as it were, by the lower mandible, and at one jerk swing it up into the air
with extreme dexterity, after which he broke its neck and dragged it ashore.
</p>

<p>
The pouch measures from six to ten inches in depth, according to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' href='#Page_381'>381</a></span>
age of the bird after the first moult. The superb male whose portrait is
before you, and which was selected from among a great number, had it
about the last mentioned size, and capable of holding a gallon of water,
were the mandibles kept horizontal. This membrane is dried and used
for keeping snuff, gunpowder and shot. When fresh it may be extended
so as to become quite thin and transparent, like a bladder.
</p>

<p>
This Pelican seldom seizes fish that are longer than its bill, and the
size of those on which it ordinarily feeds is much smaller. Indeed, several
which I examined, had in the stomach upwards of a hundred fishes,
which were only from two to three inches in length. That organ is long,
slender, and rather fleshy. In some I found a great number of live blue-coloured
worms, measuring two and a half inches in length, and about
the thickness of a crow-quill. The gut is about the size of a swan’s quill,
and from ten to twelve feet in length, according to the age of the individual.
</p>

<p>
At all periods the Brown Pelican keeps in flocks, seldom amounting
to more than fifty or sixty individuals of both sexes, and of different
ages. At the approach of the pairing time, or about the middle of April,
the old males and females separate from the rest, and remove to the
inner keys or to large estuaries, well furnished with mangroves of goodly
size. The young birds, which are much more numerous, remain along
the shores of the open sea, unless during heavy gales.
</p>

<p>
Now let us watch the full grown birds. Some skirmishes have taken
place, and the stronger males, by dint of loud snappings of their bill,
some hard tugs of the neck and head, and some heavy beats with their
wings, have driven away the weaker, which content themselves with less
prized belles. The females, although quiet and gentle on ordinary occasions,
are more courageous than the males, who, however, are assiduous
in their attentions, assist in forming the nest, feed their mates while sitting,
and even share the labour of incubation with them. Now see the
mated birds, like the citizens of a newly laid out town in some part of
our western country, breaking the dry sticks from the trees, and conveying
them in their bills to yon mangrove isle. You see they place all their
mansions on the south-west side, as if to enjoy the benefit of all the heat
of that sultry climate. Myriads of mosquitoes buzz around them, and
alight on the naked parts of their body, but this seems to give them no
concern. Stick after stick is laid, one crossing another, until a strong
platform is constructed. Now roots and withered plants are brought,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
with which a basin is formed for the eggs. Not a nest, you observe, is
placed very low; the birds prefer the tops of the mangroves, although
they do not care how many nests are on one tree, or how near the trees
are to each other. The eggs, of which there are never more than three,
are rather elliptical, and average three inches and one-eighth in length,
by two inches and one-eighth in their greatest breadth. The shell is thick
and rather rough, of a pure white colour, with a few faint streaks of a
rosy tint, and blotches of a very pale hue, from the centre towards the
crown of the egg.
</p>

<p>
The young are at first covered with cream-coloured down, and have
the bill and feet disproportionately large. They are fed with great care,
and so abundantly, that the refuse of their food, putrid and disgusting,
lies in great quantities round them; but neither young nor old regard
this, however offensive it may be to you. As the former grow the latter
bring larger fish to them. At first the food is dropped in a well macerated
state into their extended throats; afterwards the fish is given to them
entire; and finally the parent birds merely place it on the edge of the
nest. The young increase in size at a surprising rate. When half fledged
they seem a mere mass of fat, their partially indurated bill has acquired
considerable length, their wings droop by their sides, and they would be
utterly unable to walk. The Vultures at this period often fall upon them
and devour them in the absence of their parents. The Indians also carry
them off in considerable numbers; and farther eastward, on the Halifax
river, for instance, the Negroes kill all they can find, to make gombo
soup of them during winter. The crows, less powerful, but quite as cunning,
suck the eggs; and many a young one which has accidentally fallen
from the nest, is sure to be picked up by some quadruped, or devoured
by the Shark or Balacouda. When extensive depredations have thus
been made, the birds abandon their breeding places, and do not return
to them. The Pelicans in fact are, year after year, retiring from the
vicinity of man, and although they afford but very unsavoury food at
any period of their lives, will yet be hunted beyond the range of civilization,
just as our best of all game, the Wild Turkey, is now, until to
meet with them the student of nature will have to sail round Terra del
Fuego, while he may be obliged to travel to the Rocky Mountains before
he find the other bird. Should you approach a settlement of the Pelicans
and fire a few shots at them, they all abandon the place, and leave their
eggs or young entirely at your disposal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At all seasons, the Negroes of the plantations on the eastern coast of
the Floridas lie in wait for the Pelicans. There, observe that fellow,
who, with rusty musket, containing a tremendous charge of heavy shot,
is concealed among the palmettoes, on the brink of a kind of embankment
formed by the shelly sand. Now comes a flock of Pelicans, forcing
their way against the breeze, unaware of the danger into which they rush,
for there, a few yards apart, several Negroes crouch in readiness to fire;
and let me tell you, good shots they are. Now a blast forces the birds
along the shore; off goes the first gun, and down comes a Pelican; shot
succeeds shot; and now the Negroes run up to gather the spoil. They
skin the birds like so many racoons, cut off the head, wings and feet;
and should you come this way next year, you may find these remains
bleached in the sun. Towards night, the sable hunters carry off their
booty, marching along in Indian file, and filling the air with their extemporaneous
songs. At home they perhaps salt, or perhaps smoke them;
but in whatever way the Pelicans are prepared, they are esteemed good
food by the sons of Africa.
</p>

<p>
The Brown Pelican is a strong and tough bird, although not so weighty
as the white species. Its flesh is, in my opinion, always impure. It seems
never satisfied with food, and it mutes so profusely, that not a spot of verdure
can be seen on the originally glossy and deep-coloured mangroves on
which it nestles; and I must say that, much as I admire it in some respects,
I should be sorry to keep it near me as a pet.
</p>

<p>
During winter, when the mullets, a favourite fish with the Brown
Pelican, as it is with me, retires into deeper water, these birds advance
farther to seaward, and may be seen over all parts of the Gulf of Mexico,
and between the Florida Reefs and the opposite isles, especially during
fine weather. They are very sensible to cold, and in this respect are tender
birds. Now and then, at this season, they are seen on Lake Borgne
and over Lake Pontchartrain, but never on the Mississippi beyond the
rise of the tides, the space higher up being abandoned to the White Pelican.
The keenness of their sight is probably equal to that of any hawk,
and their hearing is also very acute. They are extremely silent birds,
but when excited they utter a loud and rough grunt, which is far from
musical. The young take two years to attain maturity. Several persons
in the Floridas assured me that the Brown Pelicans breed at all seasons
of the year; but as I observed nothing to countenance such an idea, I
would give it as my opinion that they raise only one brood in the season.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' href='#Page_384'>384</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Their bodies are greatly inflated by large air-cells; their bones,
though strong, are very light; and they are tough to kill.

The species of Mangrove represented in the plate is very abundant
along the coast of Florida and on almost all the Keys, excepting the Tortugas.
Those islands which are named Wet Keys are entirely formed
of Mangroves, which raising their crooked and slender stems from a bed
of mud, continue to increase until their roots and pendent branches afford
shelter to the accumulating debris, when the earth is gradually raised
above the surface of the water. No sooner has this taken place than the
Mangroves in the central part of the island begin to decay, and in the
course of time there is only an outer fringe or fence of trees, while the interior
becomes overgrown with grass and low bushes. Meantime the
Mangroves extend towards the sea, their hanging branches taking root
wherever they come in contact with the bottom, and their seeds also
springing up. I am at a loss for an object with which to compare these
trees, in order to afford you an idea of them; yet if you will figure to
yourself a tree reversed, and standing on its summit, you may obtain a
tolerable notion of their figure and mode of growth. The stem, roots
and branches are very tough and stubborn, and in some places the trees
are so intertwined that a person might find it as easy to crawl over them
as to make his way between them. They are evergreen, and their tops
afford a place of resort to various species of birds at all seasons, while
their roots and submersed branches give shelter to numberless testaceous
mollusca and small fishes. The species represented is rarely observed on
the coast of Florida of a greater height than twenty-five or thirty feet,
and its average height is not above fifteen feet. The Land Mangrove, of
which I have seen only a few, the finest of which were on Key West, is
a tall tree, much larger and better shaped than the other, with narrower
leaves and shorter fruits.

<h2>
THE FLORIDA CORMORANT.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<i><span class="smcap">Phalacrocorax floridanus.</span></i>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Few birds inhabiting the United States are so little known, or have
been so incorrectly described, as the Cormorants. Nay even some of the
European species of this genus are yet not well understood, so imperfectly
have they been studied by writers who, although they have defined their
forms, have not sufficiently studied them in the places to which they resort
during the breeding season. Of the three species of which I shall
speak in this volume, only one has been accurately described. I allude
to the Double-crested Cormorant, <i>P. dilophus</i>, which was met with by the
intrepid Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> in the course of his Arctic journeys, and introduced
to the scientific world in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, but without
a figure, a circumstance to be regretted, as good representations of
birds are fully as necessary as good descriptions. When the student has
perused both, he cannot fail to recognise the species in whatever part of
the world he may afterwards meet with it.
</p>

<p>
Our Cormorants are by no means great travellers, although they all
migrate more or less at particular seasons. The three species to which
only I shall at present allude, are each restricted to a comparatively small
portion of North America. The Large Cormorant, <i>P. Carbo</i>, rarely goes
farther north than the southern coast of Labrador, and is seldom seen as
far south as the Bay of New York. The Double-crested, <i>P. dilophus</i>,
which is next in size, proceeds farther in both directions, having been met
with by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, although my amiable friend Captain <span class="smcap">James
Clark Ross</span>, R. N. does not mention having seen any birds of this
family in the course of his voyages in the arctic seas. It breeds in great
numbers in Labrador, and during winter proceeds along our eastern coasts
sometimes as far as Charleston in South Carolina. The Florida Cormorant,
<i>P. floridanus</i>, is a constant resident in the southern parts of the
country from which it derives its name, and is more especially abundant
there in early spring and summer, breeding on the keys and along the
salt-water inlets of the southern extremity of the peninsula, from which
considerable numbers are now known to visit the waters of the Mississippi
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
and even of the Ohio, while others proceed as far eastward as Cape Hatteras,
all returning to the Floridas on the approach of cold weather.
</p>

<p>
The Florida Cormorant seldom goes far out to sea, but prefers the
neighbourhood of the shores, being found in the bays, inlets, and large
rivers. I never met with one at a greater distance from land than five
miles. It is at all seasons gregarious, although it is not always found in
large flocks. The birds of this species never suffer others of the same
genus to resort to their breeding places, although they sometimes associate
with individuals belonging to different genera. The <i>P. Carbo</i>
appropriates to itself the upper shelves of the most rugged and elevated
rocks, whose bases are washed by the sea; <i>P. dilophus</i> breeds on flat
rocky islands at some distance from the shores of the mainland; and the
Florida Cormorant nestles on trees. In the many breeding places of all
these species which I have visited, I never found individuals of one intermingled
with those of another, although the Large Cormorant did not
seem averse from having the Peregrine Falcon in its vicinity, while the
Double-crested allowed a few Gannets or Guillemots to nestle beside it,
and the Florida Cormorant associated with Herons, Frigate Pelicans,
Grakles, or Pigeons.
</p>

<p>
This species seldom flies far over land, but follows the sinuosities of the
shores or the waters of rivers, although its course towards a given point
should thus be three times as long. It is the only one of the three species
that, in as far as I have observed in America, alights on trees. My learned
friend, the Prince of Musignano, mentions in his valuable Synopsis of
the Birds of the United States, a species of Cormorant under the name
of <i>P. Graculus</i>, which he describes as being when adult greenish-black,
with a few scattered white streaks on the neck, in winter bronzed, and
having a golden-green crest, the head, neck, and thighs with short small
white feathers, and adds that it “inhabits both continents and both hemispheres:
not uncommon in spring and autumn in the Middle States:
very common in the Floridas, where it breeds, though very abundant in
the arctic and antarctic circles.” Unfortunately no dimensions are given,
except of the bill, which is said to be three and a half inches long. The
Florida Cormorant, however, does not at any season present these characters,
and therefore conceiving it to be different from any hitherto described,
I have taken the liberty of giving it a name, while the figure and
description will enable the scientific to form a distinct idea of it, and thus
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' href='#Page_389'>389</a></span>
to confirm the species, or restore to it its previous appellation, should it
have received one.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of April 1832, I and my party visited several small
Keys, not many miles distant from the harbour in which our vessel lay.
Mr <span class="smcap">Thruston</span> had given us his beautiful barge, and accompanied us
with his famous pilot, fisherman and hunter, Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span>. The Keys were
separated by narrow and tortuous channels, from the surface of the clear
waters of which were reflected the dark mangroves, on the branches of
which large colonies of Cormorants had already built their nests, and
were sitting on their eggs. There were many thousands of these birds,
and each tree bore a greater or less number of their nests, some five or
six, others perhaps as many as ten. The leaves, branches, and stems of
the trees, were in a manner white-washed with their dung. The temperature
in the shade was about 90° Fahr., and the effluvia which impregnated
the air of the channels were extremely disagreeable. Still the
mangroves were in full bloom, and the Cormorants in perfect vigour.
Our boat being secured, the people scrambled through the bushes, in
search of the eggs. Many of the birds dropped into the water, dived,
and came up at a safe distance; others in large groups flew away affrighted;
while a great number stood on their nests and the branches, as
if gazing upon beings strange to them. But alas! they soon became too
well acquainted with us, for the discharges from our guns committed
frightful havock among them. The dead were seen floating on the water,
the crippled making towards the open sea, which here extended to the
very Keys on which we were, while groups of a hundred or more swam
about a little beyond reach of our shot, awaiting the event, and the air
was filled with those whose anxiety to return to their eggs kept them
hovering over us in silence. In a short time the bottom of our boat was
covered with the slain, several hats and caps were filled with eggs; and
we may now intermit the work of destruction. You must try to excuse
these murders, which in truth might not have been nearly so numerous,
had I not thought of you quite as often while on the Florida Keys, with
a burning sun over my head, and my body oozing at every pore, as I do
now while peaceably scratching my paper with an iron-pen, in one of
the comfortable and quite cool houses of the most beautiful of all the
cities of old Scotland.
</p>

<p>
The Florida Cormorant begins to pair about the first of April, and
commences the construction of its nest about a fortnight after. Many do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
not lay quite so early, and I found some going through their preparations
until the middle of May. Their courtships are performed on the water.
On the morning, beautiful but extremely hot, of the 8th of that month,
while rambling over one of the Keys, I arrived at the entrance of a narrow
and rather deep channel, almost covered over by the boughs of the
mangroves and some tall canes, the only tall canes I had hitherto observed
among those islands. I paused, looked at the water, and observing
it to be full of fish, felt confident that no shark was at hand. Cocking
both locks of my gun, I quietly waded in. Curious sounds now
reached my ears, and as the fishes did not appear to mind me much, I
proceeded onward among them for perhaps a hundred yards, when I observed
that they had all disappeared. The sounds were loud and constantly
renewed, as if they came from a joyous multitude. The inlet
suddenly became quite narrow, and the water reached to my arm-pits.
At length I placed myself behind some mangrove trunks, whence I could
see a great number of Cormorants not more than fifteen or twenty yards
from me. None of them, it seemed, had seen or heard me; they were
engaged in going through their nuptial ceremonies. The males while
swimming gracefully round the females, would raise their wings and tail,
draw their head over their back, swell out their neck for an instant, and
with a quick forward thrust of the head utter a rough guttural note, not
unlike the cry of a pig. The female at this moment would crouch as
it were on the water, sinking into it, when her mate would sink over
her until nothing more than his head was to be seen, and soon afterwards
both sprung up and swam joyously round each other, croaking all the
while. Twenty or more pairs at a time were thus engaged. Indeed, the
water was covered with Cormorants, and, had I chosen, I might have
shot several of them. I now advanced slowly towards them, when they
stared at me as you might stare at a goblin, and began to splash the
water with their wings, many diving. On my proceeding they all dispersed,
either plunging beneath or flying off, and making rapidly towards
the mouth of the inlet. Only a few nests were on the mangroves,
and I looked upon the spot as analogous to the tournament grounds of
the Pinnated Grouse, although no battles took place in my presence. A
few beautiful Herons were sitting peaceably on their nests, the musquitoes
were very abundant, large ugly blue land-crabs crawled among the mangroves,
hurrying towards their retreats, and I retired, as I had arrived,
in perfect silence. While proceeding I could not help remarking the instinctive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' href='#Page_391'>391</a></span>
knowledge of the fishes, and thought how curious it was that, as
soon as they had observed the Cormorants’ hole, none had gone farther,
as if they were well aware of the danger, but preferred meeting me as I
advanced towards the birds. I emerged from the water almost exhausted
with heat, my eyes aching from the perspiration; but the refreshing sea-breeze
now reached me, and cooled my feverish frame. Thankful, Reader,
did I then feel, and thankful do I feel now, having survived so many encounters
of this kind.
</p>

<p>
The nest of the Florida Cormorant is of rather a small size, being only
eight or nine inches in diameter. It is formed of sticks crossing each other,
and is flat, without any appearance of finishing. All the nests are placed
on a western exposure, and are usually completely covered with excrement,
as are also frequently the eggs, which are three or four, and differ
in size, their average length, however, being two inches and a quarter,
their greatest breadth one inch and three and a half eighths. They
are rendered rather rough by the coating of calcareous matter which
surrounds them; but when this is removed, the real shell is found to be
of a uniform fine light bluish-green tint. I was unable to ascertain the
period of incubation. The young are at first blind, naked, black, and
extremely uncouth. On placing some which were quite small on the water,
they instantly dived, rose again, and swam about at random, diving
on the least noise. If you approach them when about a month old, they
throw themselves from the nest and plunge into the water. When undisturbed,
they remain in the nest until they are fully fledged and able
to fly, after which they undergo various changes, and are not perfect until
nearly two years old.
</p>

<p>
Soon after they are left to shift for themselves, great numbers go to
search for food in the quiet waters of inland streams. Thousands may
now be seen on the lakes of the interior of the Floridas, and on the large
rivers there. At this season many proceed as far as the Capes of North
Carolina, the Mississippi, the Arkansas, the Yazoo, and other streams,
including the fair Ohio, on which they are at times seen early in October,
when they begin to return to the places of their nativity. During several
weeks which I spent on the St John’s River, while on board the United
States’ schooner-of-war the Spark, I was surprised to see the number of
these Cormorants already returning towards the keys, so much so that
had I been the discoverer of that stream under similar circumstances, I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' href='#Page_392'>392</a></span>
should in all probability have named it Cormorant River. While we were
at anchor near its mouth, they passed close to us in long single files almost
continually, and, on reaching the sea, bore away towards the south along
the shores.
</p>

<p>
On the Mississippi, in the month of October, when the temperature is
considerably lower than in the Floridas, you see these birds during the
day standing in their usual inclined position, on the sawyers and planters,
as if resting there—so at least was the case in the autumn of 1820,—or on
the dead branches of trees along the shores. In cloudy days they sailed
high in the air, and in wide circles, after which, as if aware of cold
weather being at hand, they swiftly followed in long lines the meandering
course of the stream, at a considerable elevation. While sailing aloft,
they frequently uttered a note not unlike that of the raven in similar circumstances.
When approached while standing on a planter, instead of
taking to wing at once, although elevated several feet above the water,
they prefer plunging first into the stream, when they almost instantly rise
to the surface, paddle with their feet, and beat with their wings for twenty
or thirty yards, and then rise into the air. Now and then, when of a
sudden the weather becomes cold at night, you see them at early dawn
join in numbers of fifty or perhaps a hundred, rise high in the air, arrange
themselves in angular double files, and fly swiftly southward.
</p>

<p>
When in fresh water streams they fish principally in the eddies, and
as soon as one of them is depopulated, or proves unworthy of their farther
search, they rise and fly about a foot above the surface to another
place, where they continue to fish. In the inner lakes of the Floridas
they fish at random any where, and this is equally the case around the
Keys, and on the bays and inlets along the coast. In fine calm weather,
when the sun is pouring down a flood of light and heat, the Cormorants
in flocks betake themselves to some clean sand-bar or rocky isle, or alight
on trees, where they spread out their wings, and bask at times for hours,
in the manner of Vultures and Pelicans.
</p>

<p>
The Florida Cormorant, like all the other species with which I am
acquainted, swims deep, and dives with great expertness, so that it is almost
useless to follow one when wounded, unless it has been greatly injured.
On seeing an enemy approach, it first beats the water with its
wings, as if in play, or as it would do if washing itself, raises both wings
for a minute or more, then paddles off, and takes to wing. When on a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
lake, they prefer diving to flying, swim with all but the neck and head
under water, in the manner of the Anhinga or Snake-bird, and easily
dive without shewing their backs.
</p>

<p>
They procure their food entirely by diving from the surface of the
water, never from on wing, as some compilers assert; nay, the very form
of their bill, and the want of air-cells, such as plunging birds are usually
provided with, prevent them from darting from above into the water, as
is the habit of Gannets and other birds, which seek for food on wing, go
far out to sea, and stand gales such as the Cormorant, which rarely venture
out of sight of the shores, does not dare to encounter, or of those
which, like Gulls, pass swiftly in curved lines over the surface, picking
up their prey. On emerging, these Cormorants usually swallow their
prey if it has been so seized as to enable them to do so with ease; if not,
they throw it up to a short distance in the air, receive it with open bill,
and gulp it head foremost. If the fish is large, they swim or fly to the
shore, or alight on a tree with it, and there beat and tear it to pieces,
after which they swallow it. Their appetite is scarcely satiable, and they
gorge themselves to the utmost at every convenient opportunity.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is perhaps more rapid than that of the others
mentioned above, and is performed by continued flappings when the bird
is travelling, but by alternate flappings and sailings of great elegance
during the beginning of the breeding season, or when they collect in large
flocks in lowering weather, sometimes also when about to alight. Their
food consists chiefly of fish, and they generally prefer those of small
size. While on the Florida Keys, I procured five specimens of the Hippocampus,
fresh and uninjured, from the gullets of some of these Cormorants.
They are hard to kill, and live to a great age.
</p>

<p>
They are easily treated in captivity; but their awkward movements
on the ground, where they often use the tail as a support, render them
less pleasing objects than other feathered pets. Besides, they eat and
mute inordinately, and instead of charming you with songs, utter no
sound excepting a grunt. Their flesh is dark, generally tough, and has
a rank fishy taste, which can suit the palate only of refined epicures, some
of whom I have heard pronounce it excellent. The Indians and Negroes
of the Floridas kill the young when nearly able to fly, and after skinning
them, salt them for food. I have seen them offered for sale in the New
Orleans market, the poorer people there making gombo soup of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A bird of this species, which I shot near its breeding place, and which,
on being examined, proved to be a female, had the feathers of the tail
covered with delicate slender sea-weeds of a bright green colour, such as
I have often observed on marine turtles, and which appeared to have actually
grown there.
</p>

<p>
The slender feathers on the sides of the head fall off by the time incubation
has commenced, and do not appear during winter, as is alleged
by authors when speaking of the crests or appendages of Cormorants, nor
do they last more than a few weeks, as is also the case in the Egrets and
Herons.

THE POMARINE JAGER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Lestris pomarinus</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLIII. Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
This bird I never had an opportunity of examining until I visited
Labrador; nor am I able to give you much information respecting its
habits as obtained by my own observation, and therefore I shall take the
liberty of adding to my description such notices as I may judge interesting,
taken from the works of authors who, having seen for themselves, are
entitled to credit.
</p>

<p>
While sailing towards the harbour of Little Macatina, and yet about
forty miles distant from it, although not far from the shore, we observed
a bird of this species approaching the vessel. It flew in the manner of the
Pigeon Hawk, to my account of which I may refer you, alighted on the
water like a Gull, and fed on some cod-fish’s liver that had been thrown
overboard for the purpose of attracting it. Several small Petrels joined
it, but it did not come within shot, and the sea was too rough for even
our whale-boat. On the 30th of July the young men of my party brought
me a fine adult female, in excellent order, from which I drew the figure
in the plate. A few days after we experienced a very heavy gale while
in the harbour of Bras d’Or, during the continuance of which twenty or
thirty of these birds came about us, although none of them approached
within shot, and no boat could have ridden the furious waves without imminent
danger. On that occasion, however, I was enabled to observe
some of their habits. They flew wildly about, yet with much grace, moving
rapidly to and fro, now struggling against the blast, now bearing off
and drifting to a considerable distance. Many Gulls were flying about,
having also made for the harbour to obtain some shelter from the storm.
The Lestris chased the smaller species with effect, but never approached
the Great Black-backed Gulls, nor even their young, which were also flying
with the rest. The Kittiwakes and the Ring-billed Gulls were the
species which we saw them attack, although they did not procure much
food from them, the weather being such that they could not fish. They
were therefore contented, as was the Lestris, with the fishes that had been
thrown on shore. At times the Jagers would ramble over the land,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
flying close upon the rocks, and proceeding at a rapid rate even against
the wind. They remained in our neighbourhood until the tempest abated,
when they went off to sea, and I saw no more of them until we reached
St George’s Bay in Newfoundland.
</p>

<p>
There, on a squally afternoon, two or three of them were observed
flying around, but keeping at such a distance that we could not shoot any
of them. The following day, after setting sail, we encountered a heavy
gale, which, although foretold by me from the appearance of the birds in
the harbour, our good captain would not believe as likely to happen. We
were obliged to lie-to, and were tossed about for three nights and days,
but escaped with little other damage than the loss of a pet Gull, which
was washed overboard.
</p>

<p>
On our return to Eastport, Captain <span class="smcap">Emery</span> told me that he had seen
a great number of these Jagers near Cape Sable; and at Halifax, in Nova
Scotia, I was assured that they breed on Sable Island, which is sixty or
seventy miles distant from the coast. I never observed one of these birds
along the shores of the United States, although some of the genus go as
far south in winter as the Gulf of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is known with certainty respecting the changes which this
species undergoes as it advances toward maturity. Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark
Ross</span>, R. N. has informed me that a nest containing two eggs was found
by him near Fury Point, close by the edge of a small lake. I have no
doubt that this bird breeds in Labrador, as the female which I obtained
in July appeared as if it had young at the time.
</p>

<p>
My friend Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span> states that he is not aware that an adult bird
has yet been killed in Britain. M. <span class="smcap">Temminck</span> says it forms a rude nest
of grass and moss, which is placed on a tuft in the marshes, or on a rock,
and lays two or three very pointed eggs, of a greyish-olive colour, marked
with a few blackish spots. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> has the following notice respecting
it in the Fauna Boreali-Americana:—“The Pomarine Jager or
Gull-hunter is not uncommon in the Arctic seas and northern outlets of
Hudson’s Bay, where it subsists on putrid fish and other animal substances
thrown up by the sea, and also on the matters which the Gulls
disgorge when pursued by it. It retires from the north in the winter,
and makes its first appearance at Hudson’s Bay in May, coming in from
seaward.”

The habits of this beautiful species are little known, for so irregularly
does it perform its migrations, and so rarely does it settle for any length of
time in any part of the United States, that at present few opportunities of
studying them occur. Although I have found individuals in various places
along our eastern coast, from Boston to New Jersey, as well as in Kentucky
and other portions of the Union, I have not seen its nest, nor even
its eggs. Mr <span class="smcap">Drummond</span>, whose zeal as a student of nature must be
known to every one devoted to natural history, had the good fortune to
find its nest in the course of his rambles among the Rocky Mountains,
but he has given no information respecting its habits. A person who
shewed me the skins of two specimens procured in July near Cape May
in New Jersey, assured me that he shot them near their nests, and that
they had four eggs. While I was in the same neighbourhood, in the
month of June 1829, a fisherman gunner, with whom I was at the time
residing at Great Egg Harbour, brought me a pair which he had just
killed. He represented them as very gentle and easily approached, and
said that on going towards them they affected to be lame, and opened
their wings as if to induce him to run after them; instead of doing which,
however, he immediately fired and killed them both. Having put away
the birds in a safe place, he and I took to his boat and went to the island
where he had found them. He shewed me the spot on which they had
been shot; but although we searched most diligently for the nest, we
could not find it. On examining the birds when we returned, I saw that
the female must have been sitting. About the same period my son procured
two specimens of this Phalarope out of a flock of five, on the rocks
at the rapids of the Ohio below Louisville. Late in the summer of 1824
I shot three of them near Buffalo Creek on Lake Erie. My generous
friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>, Esq. presented me, at New York, with a young
bird in autumnal plumage, from which I made the figure in the plate;
and another, in a most emaciated state, was given me at Boston in the
winter by my young friend <span class="smcap">John Bethune</span>, Esq.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Those which I procured near Lake Erie were engaged in feeding
around the borders and in the shallows of a pond of small extent. When
I first observed them at some distance, I thought they were Yellow-shanks
(<i>Totanus flavipes</i>), so much did their motions resemble those of that species.
Like it, this Phalarope wades in the water up to its body, picks for
food right and left, turns about, and performs all its motions with vivacity
and elegance. They kept closer together than the Yellow-shanks
usually do, but, like them, they would for a few moments raise their wings
as if apprehensive of getting into too deep water and being obliged to fly.
They preferred flying to swimming on such occasions, although from the
general character of the tribe one might expect otherwise. After watching
them about a quarter of an hour, during which time they did not utter
a single note, I fired at them when they were all close together, and killed
the whole. On opening them I found their stomachs to contain small
worms and fragments of very delicate shells. The birds seen at the Falls
of the Ohio flew in the manner of the Common Snipe, proceeding at first
in an undulating or zigzag line, but more steadily after reaching a certain
elevation, when they came pretty close together, wheeled a few times, and
alighted again near the same shallow pools.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, who found this species breeding on the Saskatchewan,
says “it lays two or three eggs among the grass on the margins of small
lakes: they are very obtuse at one end, taper much at the other, and have
a colour intermediate between yellowish-grey and cream-yellow, interspersed
with small roundish spots and a few larger blotches of umber-brown,
more crowded at the obtuse end. The eggs measure sixteen lines
and a half in length and eleven across.”
</p>

<p>
I observed scarcely any difference in the colouring of the sexes, the
female being merely larger than the male.

<h2>
THE RED PHALAROPE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Phalaropus fulicarius</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLV. Adult Male and Female in Summer, and Adult in Winter.</span>
</p>

<p>
My first drawing of the Red Phalarope was made at Louisville in
Kentucky, a few weeks after my removal to that place, in 1808. One afternoon,
while returning from the house of my hospitable friend General
<span class="smcap">Croghan</span>, I observed a large flock of birds proceeding along the shores
of the Ohio. They were quite unknown to me, and therefore extremely
anxious I was to procure some of them. I therefore ran through the
woods until I got ahead of them, went to the margin of the river, and
concealed myself at some distance from them. They swam beautifully,
played about, picked up substances floating on the water, now dispersed,
and again came close together, until at length coming opposite to a small
sand-bar stretching out from the shore to the distance of a few yards,
they directed their course towards it, and waded out. When just landing,
they were so close to each other that I could not withstand the temptation,
and so levelled my gun, pulled both triggers, and saw that I had
made considerable havock among them. Those which had not been bitten
flew off in a compact body, while the birds that had been but slightly
wounded made for the water, and swam away so fast that they seemed to
be running on the surface. I picked up seventeen, which I found so
beautiful and withal so plump, that I felt quite delighted, and resolved
to shoot as many more as I could. But I did not succeed in killing more
than other five that day.
</p>

<p>
I had never until then seen a Phalarope of any kind, although I
had inspected some shocking figures of these elegant birds, figures so unlike
the originals that even with the aid of a name printed beneath, you
could not recognise them. Such of my acquaintances at Louisville as had
been accustomed to shoot birds, had never seen one of this species on the
Ohio, or in any part of the country. It was then and there that I made
my first drawing of the Red Phalarope, which I shewed to <span class="smcap">Alexander
Wilson</span> during his visit to Louisville. It being late in October, the
specimens which I had procured were all in their grey livery, and proved
capital eating. As I was anxious to watch the rest of the flock, which I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>
think must have been composed of at least a hundred individuals, I went
to the same place on the following afternoon. As I crossed Bear Grass
Creek, near its junction with the Ohio, I observed eight or ten of them
walking over the green moss on the surface of the water near the shore.
Of these I succeeded in killing three. In the course of a walk of two miles
along the banks of the river, I could see none; and some Blue-winged
Teals happening to pass over from the stream in the direction of a pond
between it and Kieger’s Ferry-house, I went in pursuit of them. Before
I got up they had flown away, or had passed over without alighting. There,
however, to my great joy, I found all the Phalaropes swimming along the
margins and picking up the seeds of grasses. They were much less shy
than when I met with them on the river, so that I soon procured eight
more at a single shot. The rest rose, emitting quick sharp cries, performed
a few evolutions at a considerable height, and went off to the westward.
</p>

<p>
On the 1st of September 1831, while on board the packet ship Columbia,
commanded by my good friend <span class="smcap">Joseph Delano</span>, Esq. Nantucket
being distant about sixty miles, we came upon an extensive bank of sea-weeds
and froth, about a mile in length, which I was told was produced
by the action of the tides. On this bed were hundreds of Phalaropes
of this species, walking as unconcernedly as if on land. As we approached
it, they rose and flew around the vessel for a few minutes, and when we
had passed through we saw them re-alight.
</p>

<p>
I have not seen the Red Phalarope alive on any other occasion than
those mentioned above; and I am indebted to my generous friend Captain
<span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span> for the beautiful specimens in summer plumage,
from which the figures in the plate were taken.
</p>

<p>
None of those which I had wounded attempted to dive. When caught
and held in the hand, they merely fluttered and tried to escape, like other
small birds. Their flight was rapid, resembling that of the Red-backed
Sandpiper, <i>Tringa alpina</i>, and they performed various evolutions, sometimes
skimming over the water, when they kept more apart than either
when rising at first, or when they reached a certain height, on attaining
which they pursued their course, with alternate inclinations to either side.
</p>

<p>
According to Captain <span class="smcap">J. C. Ross</span>, these birds breed in great numbers
far north. The eggs, of which he has favoured me with some, measure
an inch and a quarter by seven-eighths; their ground colour is dull greenish-yellow,
irregularly blotched and dotted with reddish-brown.

<h2>
BREAKING UP THE ICE.
</h2>

<p>
While proceeding up the Mississippi above its junction with the Ohio,
I found, to my great mortification, that its navigation was obstructed by
ice. The chief conductor of my bark, who was a Canadian Frenchman,
was therefore desired to take us to a place suitable for winter-quarters,
which he accordingly did, bringing us into a great bend of the river called
Tawapatee Bottom. The waters were unusually low, the thermometer
indicated excessive cold, the earth all around was covered with snow, dark
clouds were spread over the heavens, and as all appearances were unfavourable
to the hope of a speedy prosecution of our voyage, we quietly
set to work. Our bark, which was a large keel-boat, was moored close
to the shore, the cargo was conveyed to the woods, large trees were
felled over the water, and were so disposed as to keep off the pressure
of the floating masses of ice. In less than two days, our stores, baggage,
and ammunition, were deposited in a great heap under one of the
magnificent trees of which the forest was here composed, our sails were
spread over all, and a complete camp was formed in the wilderness. Every
thing around us seemed dreary and dismal, and had we not been endowed
with the faculty of deriving pleasure from the examination of nature, we
should have made up our minds to pass the time in a state similar to that
of bears during their hybernation. We soon found employment, however,
for the woods were full of game; and deer, turkeys, racoons, and
opossums might be seen even around our camp; while on the ice that now
covered the broad stream rested flocks of swans, to surprise which the
hungry wolves were at times seen to make energetic but unsuccessful
efforts. It was curious to see the snow-white birds all lying flat on the
ice, but keenly intent on watching the motions of their insidious enemies,
until the latter advanced within the distance of a few hundred yards, when
the swans, sounding their trumpet-notes of alarm, would all rise, spread
out their broad wings, and after running some yards and battering the
ice until the noise was echoed like thunder through the woods, rose exultingly
into the air, leaving their pursuers to devise other schemes for
gratifying their craving appetites.
</p>

<p>
The nights being extremely cold, we constantly kept up a large fire,
formed of the best wood. Fine trees of ash and hickory were felled, cut
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' href='#Page_409'>409</a></span>
up into logs of convenient size, and rolled into a pile, on the top of which,
with the aid of twigs, a fire was kindled. There were about fifteen of
us, some hunters, others trappers, and all more or less accustomed to live
in the woods. At night, when all had returned from their hunting-grounds,
some successful and others empty-handed, they presented a picture
in the strong glare of the huge fire that illuminated the forest, which
it might prove interesting to you to see, were it copied by a bold hand on
canvass. Over a space of thirty yards or more, the snow was scraped
away, and piled up into a circular wall, which protected us from the cold
blast. Our cooking utensils formed no mean display, and before a week
had elapsed, venison, turkeys, and racoons hung on the branches in profusion.
Fish, too, and that of excellent quality, often graced our board,
having been obtained by breaking holes in the ice of the lakes. It was
observed that the opossums issued at night from holes in the banks of the
river, to which they returned about day-break; and having thus discovered
their retreat, we captured many of them by means of snares.
</p>

<p>
At the end of a fortnight our bread failed, and two of the party were
directed to proceed across the bend, towards a village on the western
bank of the Mississippi, in quest of that commodity; for although we
had a kind of substitute for it in the dry white flesh of the breast of the
wild turkey, bread is bread after all, and more indispensable to civilized
man than any other article of food. The expedition left the camp early
one morning; one of the party boasted much of his knowledge of woods,
while the other said nothing, but followed. They walked on all day, and
returned next morning to the camp with empty wallets. The next attempt,
however, succeeded, and they brought on a sledge a barrel of flour
and some potatoes. After a while, we were joined by many Indians, the
observation of whose manners afforded us much amusement.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks were spent in Tawapatee Bottom. The waters had kept
continually sinking, and our boat lay on her side high and dry. On both
sides of the stream, the ice had broken into heaps, forming huge walls.
Our pilot visited the river daily, to see what prospect there might be of
a change. One night, while, excepting himself, all were sound asleep, he
suddenly roused us with loud cries of “the ice is breaking! get up, get
up, down to the boat lads, bring out your axes, hurry on, or we may lose
her, here let us have a torch!” Starting up, as if we had been attacked
by a band of savages, we ran pell-mell to the bank. The ice was indeed
breaking up; it split with reports like those of heavy artillery, and as the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
water had suddenly risen from an overflow of the Ohio, the two streams
seemed to rush against each other with violence, in consequence of which
the congealed mass was broken into large fragments, some of which rose
nearly erect here and there, and again fell with thundering crash, as the
wounded whale, when in the agonies of death, springs up with furious
force, and again plunges into the foaming waters. To our surprise, the
weather, which in the evening had been calm and frosty, had become wet
and blowy. The water gushed from the fissures formed in the ice, and
the prospect was extremely dismal. When day dawned, a spectacle
strange and fearful presented itself: the whole mass of water was violently
agitated, its covering was broken into small fragments, and although
not a foot of space was without ice, not a step could the most daring have
ventured to make upon it. Our boat was in imminent danger, for the trees
which had been placed to guard it from the ice were cut or broken into
pieces, and were thrust against her. It was impossible to move her; but
our pilot ordered every man to bring down great bunches of cane, which
were lashed along her sides; and before these were destroyed by the ice,
she was afloat and riding above it. While we were gazing on the scene,
a tremendous crash was heard, which seemed to have taken place about
a mile below, when suddenly the great dam of ice gave way. The current
of the Mississippi had forced its way against that of the Ohio; and
in less than four hours, we witnessed the complete breaking up of the ice.
</p>

<p>
During that winter, the ice was so thick on the Mississippi, that opposite
St Louis, horses and heavy waggons crossed the river. Many
boats had been detained in the same manner as our own, so that provisions
and other necessary articles had become very scarce, and sold at a
high price. This happened about twenty-eight years ago.

<p>
While sailing towards the Florida Keys, my mind was agitated with
anticipations of the delight I should experience in exploring a region
whose productions were very imperfectly known. Often did I think of
the Heron named after <span class="smcap">Titian Peale</span>, by my learned friend the Prince
of Musignano. Mr <span class="smcap">Peale</span> had procured only a single specimen, and in
the winter season, but whether or not the species was abundant on the
Keys of Florida remained to be discovered. No sooner had I been landed
and formed an acquaintance with Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span>, the pilot of whom I have
often spoken, who was well acquainted with the haunts of many of the
birds of those islands, than I asked him respecting the various Herons
which might be found there or on the shores of the mainland. Before answering
me, he counted his fingers slowly, and then said that he could
recollect only “twelve sorts;” “but,” added he, “these birds change
their colours so curiously, that it is past wonder with me to believe that
any one man could know them without watching them as I have done for
many years.” I then inquired if I was in good time to procure all the
sorts which he knew. He answered in the affirmative; but felt some
doubt as to my procuring the eggs of one kind at least, which breed
earlier than the rest, and was pure white from the shell, and the largest
of all. Thinking the species to which he alluded might be the <i>Ardea
alba</i> of <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>, I asked if it had long thread-like feathers over the tail
during the breeding season. “Oh no, Sir,” said he, “it never has; it is
as tall as yourself, and when you see some on the wing, you will be pleased,
for their wings are as large as those of the Brown Pelican. The one I guess
you mean, mostly goes farther to the eastward to breed, along with a very
small one, also always white, with the feathers over the tail as you say,
and curled upwards. These are the only three sorts that are white.”
I begged him to describe the colours of the others, which he did so well
that I recognised ten species in all; but the large white one, and another
of a grey and purple colour, were unknown to me, and I told him so,
stating at the same time how anxious I was to procure them if possible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“If possible! nothing in the world can be more easy, for if they have no
eggs left, they have young ones enough to load your schooner. I can
take you straight to their breeding place.”
</p>

<p>
You may suppose, Reader, how my spirits were raised by this intelligence,
and how surprised I was that <span class="smcap">Peale</span>’s Egret was not in the number
of the Florida Herons. We speedily embarked in Mr <span class="smcap">Thruston</span>’s boat,
spread our sails to the breeze, and passed several keys, on which we procured
two young birds of the large white species, which I saw at once
was unknown to me, but of which you will find an account in this volume.
As we approached the next island, I saw twenty or thirty pairs of Herons,
some of which were pure white, others of a light blue colour, but so much
larger than the Blue Heron, <i>Ardea cœrulea</i>, that I asked the pilot what
they were, when he answered, “the very fellows I want to shew you, and
you may soon see them close enough, as you and I will shoot a few by
way of amusement.” Before half an hour had elapsed, more than a dozen
were lying at my feet. Some of them were as white as driven snow, the
rest of a delicate purplish tint, inclining to grey on the back and wings,
with heads and necks of a curious reddish colour. Males and females
there were, but they were all of one species, for my companion assured
me that “this sort bred before they turned to their natural colours,” by
which he meant before attaining their full plumage at the age of three
years. Well, the immature birds were the very same as the individual to
which, as the representative of a new species, the name of Peale’s Egret
had been given. This I saw at once, for so good is the representation of
it in the fourth volume of <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>’s American Ornithology, that from
the mere recollection of it I was enabled to recognise the bird at once.
You may imagine the pleasure I felt, as well as that which I experienced
on becoming better acquainted with this species, which I found in many
places both with eggs and with young.
</p>

<p>
The Reddish Egret is a constant resident on the Florida Keys, to which
it is so partial at all seasons that it never leaves them. Some individuals are
seen as far east as Cape Florida, and westward along the Gulf of Mexico.
Whether it may ever betake itself to fresh water I cannot say, but I never
found one in such a situation. It is a more plump bird for its size than
most other Herons, and in this respect resembles the Night Heron and the
Yellow-crowned species, but possesses all the gracefulness of the tribe to
which it belongs. In walking it lifts its feet high, and proceeds at a
quiet pace, but sometimes briskly; it alights with ease on trees, and walks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' href='#Page_413'>413</a></span>
well on the larger branches. It rarely feeds from the edges of the water,
but resorts to the shallows of the extensive mud or sand flats, so numerous
about the keys. There, twenty or thirty, sometimes so many as a
hundred, may be seen wading up to the heel (or knee-joint as it is usually
called) in pursuit of prey, or standing in silence awaiting the approach
of an animal on which it feeds, when it strikes it, and immediately swallows
it, if not too large; but if so, it carries it to the shore, beats it, and
tears it to pieces, rarely, however, using its feet for that purpose, and certainly
never employing its pectinated claws, which no Heron that I know
ever uses for any other object than that of scratching its head, or perhaps
of securing its steps on rocky bottoms. These birds remain on
the flats thus employed, until the advance of the tide forces them to the
land.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this Heron is more elevated and regular than that of
the smaller species. During the love season, it is peculiarly graceful and
elegant, especially when one unmated male is pursuing another, a female
being in sight. They pass through the air with celerity, turn and cut
about in curious curves and zigzags, the stronger bird frequently erecting
its beautiful crest, and uttering its note, at the moment when it expects
to give its rival a thrust. When these aërial combats take place between
old and immature birds, their different colours form a striking contrast,
extremely pleasing to the beholder. While travelling to and from their
feeding grounds, or from one key to another, they propel themselves by
easy, well-sustained, and regular flappings of their extended wings, the
neck reposing on the shoulders, the legs stretched out behind like a rudder,
while their beautiful thready trains float in the breeze. On approaching
a landing place, they seldom fail to perform a few circumvolutions,
in order to see that all around is quiet, for they are more shy and
wary than the smaller Herons, and almost as suspicious as the two larger
species, <i>Ardea occidentalis</i>, and <i>A. Herodias</i>; and this becomes apparent
as soon as they discontinue the feeding of their young, when you find it
extremely difficult to approach them. After this period I rarely shot one,
unless I happened to come upon it unawares, or while it was passing over
me when among the mangroves.
</p>

<p>
About the beginning of April, these Herons begin to pair. The
males chase each other on the ground, as well as in the air, and on returning
to their chosen females erect their crest and plumes, swell out
their necks, pass and repass before them, and emit hollow rough sounds,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' href='#Page_414'>414</a></span>
which it is impossible for me to describe. It is curious to see a party of
twenty or thirty on a sand-bar, presenting as they do a mixture of colours
from pure white to the full hues of the old birds of either sex; and still
more curious perhaps it is to see a purple male paying his addresses to a
white female, while at hand a white male is caressing a purple female, and
not far off are a pair of white, and another of purple birds. Nay, reader,
until I had witnessed these remarkable circumstances, I felt some distrust
respecting the statement of the worthy pilot. I am even now doubtful
if all the young breed the first spring after their birth, and am more inclined
to think that they do not, on account of the large flocks of white
birds of this species which during the breeding time kept apart from those
that had nests, but which on examination were not found to be barren
birds, although they had the crests and pendent feathers less elongated
than those white individuals that were actually breeding.
</p>

<p>
By the middle of April, they construct their nests, which they place
for the most part on the south-western sides of the mangroves immediately
bordering the keys, never on the trees at a distance from the water, and
rarely very close together. Some are placed on the top branches, others
a foot or two above the highest tide-mark; many of them are annually
repaired, perhaps all that stand the winter gales. The nest, which is quite
flat, is large for the size of the bird, and is formed of dry sticks, interspersed
with grass and leaves. The eggs are three, average an inch and
three quarters in length, one and three-eighths in breadth, have an elliptical
form, and a smooth shell, of a uniform rather pale sea-green colour. They
afford excellent eating. Both sexes incubate, but I did not ascertain the
time required for hatching.
</p>

<p>
The young while yet naked are of a dark colour, there being only a
few scanty tufts of long soft down on the head and other parts; but
when the feathers begin to sprout they became white. Being abundantly
and carefully fed, at first by regurgitation, they grow fast, and soon become
noisy. When about a month old, they are fed less frequently, and
the fish is merely dropt before them, or into their open throats; soon after
they sit upright on the nest, with their legs extended forward, or
crawl about on the branches, as all other Herons are wont to do. They
are now sensible of danger, and when a boat is heard coming towards them
they hide among the branches, making towards the interior of the keys,
where it is extremely difficult to follow them. On one occasion, when I
was desirous of procuring some of them alive, to take to Charleston, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
took more than an hour to catch eight or nine of them, for they moved so
fast and stealthily through the mangroves, always making for the closest
and most tangled parts, that a man was obliged to keep his eyes constantly
on a single individual, which it was very difficult to do, on account of the
number of birds crossing each other in every direction. They do not fly
until they are six or seven weeks old, and even then do not venture beyond
the island on which they have been reared. In captivity, those
which we had procured feed freely, and soon became tolerably docile.
They were supplied with pieces of green turtle and other species of the
tribe, and some of them reached Charleston in good health. One continued
alive for nearly two years with my friend the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>.
It was allowed to walk in the garden and poultry-yard, and ate
an enormous quantity of small fish and all sorts of garbage, contenting
itself, when better food was scarce, with the entrails of fowls, and even
fed freely on moistened corn-meal or mush. It caught insects with great
dexterity, and was very gentle and familiar, frequently going into the
kitchen, where it was a great favourite. It had acquired a crest and a
few of the pendent feathers of the back by the month of January, when
about twenty-two months old. One cold night, it was accidentally neglected,
and in the morning was found dead, having shared the fate of so many
thousands of pet birds in all parts of the world. On being opened, it was
found to be a male. Although I have not been able to trace the gradual
changes of colour which this species undergoes, I have little doubt that
it will be found to attain maturity the third spring after birth.
</p>

<p>
The Reddish Egret rarely associates with others; nor does it suffer
them to nestle on the same island with itself. In this respect, it differs
from all other Herons with which I am acquainted; for although the Great
White Heron, <i>A. occidentalis</i>, has a decided antipathy to the Great Blue
Heron, still it now and then allows a few to breed on the north side of its
island. The present species is as strictly marine as the Great White
Heron; and these are the only two that are so, for all the others feed on
fresh-water fishes, not less than on those obtained in salt-water, as well as
on other food of various kinds. Like all others, the Reddish Egret
loses its ornaments soon after incubation, when old and young mix, and
follow their occupations together. When wounded, it strikes with its bill,
scratches with its claws, and, throwing itself on its back, emits its rough
and harsh notes, keeping all the while its crest erected and expanded,
and its feathers swelled out. Its principal food consists of fishes of various
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
sizes, of which it consumes a great number, and of which it finds no
difficulty in procuring a sufficiency, as all the waters of those portions of
the Floridas that are inhabited by it are very profusely stocked. I was
told that, although still plentiful in the Floridas, this species was much
more so when the keys were first settled. I was present when a person
killed twenty-eight in succession in about an hour, the poor birds hovering
above their island in dismay, and unaware of the destructive power
of their enemy.
</p>

<p>
The remarkable circumstance of this bird’s changing from white to
purple will no doubt have some tendency to disconcert the systematists,
who, it seems, pronounce all the birds which they name Egrets to be always
white; but how much more disconcerted must they be when they
see that among the Herons peculiarly so named, which they say are always
coloured, the largest known to exist in the United States is pure
white. It is not at present my intention to say what an Egret is, or what
a Heron is; but it can no longer be denied that the presence or absence
of a loose crest, floating plume, and a white colour, are insufficient for
establishing essential characters separating Egrets from Herons, which in
fact display the most intimate connection, the one group running into the
other in an almost imperceptible gradation. Hoping that an account of
the extent of the migrations of the twelve species of Heron that occur in
the United States, and whose habits I have studied for many years under
the most favourable circumstances, may prove acceptable, I now lay one
before you, arranging the species according to size, without regard to the
rank they hold in systematic works.
</p>

<p>
1. The Great White Heron. <i>Ardea occidentalis.</i> A constant resident
on the southern keys of Florida; entirely maritime; never goes
farther eastward than Cape Florida, though in winter the younger birds
migrate southward, and perhaps pass beyond the extremities of the Gulf
of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
2. The Great Blue Heron. <i>Ardea Herodias.</i> A constant resident
in the Floridas; migrates throughout the Union, and as far along the
Atlantic coast as the southernmost islands of the Gulf of St Lawrence in
summer; breeds in all the districts, and at the approach of winter returns
to the Southern States.
</p>

<p>
3. The White Heron. <i>Ardea alba.</i> Resident in the Floridas; migrates
to the eastward sometimes as far as Massachusetts, and up the
Mississippi as far as the city of Natchez; never seen far inland.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
</p>

<p>
4. The Purple Heron. <i>Ardea rufescens.</i> Resident on the Florida
Keys; entirely maritime; never seen farther eastward than Cape Florida;
the young sometimes remove southward in winter.
</p>

<p>
5. The American Bittern. <i>Ardea minor.</i> A winter resident in the
Floridas; many migrate over the greater part of the Union and beyond
its northern limits; never seen in Kentucky; return before winter to the
Southern States.
</p>

<p>
6. The Night Heron. <i>Ardea Nycticorax.</i> Resident in the Floridas;
migrates eastward as far as Maine, up the Mississippi as high as Memphis;
none seen in Kentucky; returns to the Southern States at the approach
of winter, and occurs at the distance of a hundred miles inland.
</p>

<p>
7. The Yellow-crowned Heron. <i>Ardea violacea.</i> A few spend the
winter in the Floridas; it rarely migrates farther eastward than New
Jersey; proceeds up the Mississippi to Natchez; never goes far inland;
the greatest number winter beyond the southern limits of the United
States.
</p>

<p>
8. The Blue Heron. <i>Ardea cœrulea.</i> Resident in the Floridas; migrates
eastward as far as Long Island; proceeds up the Mississippi about
a hundred miles above Natchez; never goes far inland.
</p>

<p>
9. The Louisiana Heron. <i>Ardea Ludoviciana.</i> Resident in the Floridas;
rarely seen as far east as New Jersey; seldom passes Natchez on
the Mississippi; never goes far inland.
</p>

<p>
10. The White Egret. <i>Ardea candidissima.</i> Resident in the Floridas;
migrates eastward as far as New York, up the Mississippi as far
as Memphis; never goes far inland; returns to the Southern States as
soon as the young are able to travel.
</p>

<p>
11. The Green Heron. <i>Ardea virescens.</i> Resident in the Floridas;
disperses over the Union; goes far inland; the greater number return at
the approach of winter to the Southern States.
</p>

<p>
12. The Least Bittern. <i>Ardea exilis.</i> Resident in the Floridas;
migrates as far as Maine, and throughout the Western Country, far up
the Missouri; returns early in autumn to the Southern States.
</p>

<p>
You will see from the above statement, that the Herons are almost
similar to our Pigeons in respect to the extent of their migrations, which
must appear the more remarkable on account of their comparative size,
<i>Ardea Herodias</i> and <i>A. virescens</i> corresponding in a great degree to the
<i>Columba migratoria</i> and <i>C. carolinensis</i>.

<p>
Bill much longer than the head, straight, compressed, tapering, the
mandibles nearly equal in size. Upper mandible with the dorsal line
nearly straight, the ridge broad and convex at the base, afterwards very
narrow, a groove from the base to near the end, beneath which the sides
are convex, the edges thin and sharp, with a notch on each side close to
the narrow but obtuse tip. Nostrils basal, linear, longitudinal. Lower
mandible with the angle long and extremely narrow, the dorsal line beyond
it ascending and very slightly convex, the edges sharp and slightly
inflected, the tip very narrow but obtuse.

Head rather small, oblong, compressed. Neck very long and slender.
Body slender and compressed. Feet very long; tibia elongated and
slender, its lower half bare, covered all round with angular scales; tarsus
elongated, slender, compressed, covered anteriorly with numerous
large scutella, laterally and behind with angular scales. Toes of moderate
length, rather slender, scutellate above, reticularly granulate beneath;
third toe considerably longer than the fourth, which is in nearly the same
proportion longer than the second, the first much shorter, but strong;
claws rather small, strong, arched, compressed, obtuse, that of hind toe
much larger, the inner edge of that of the third regularly pectinated.
</p>

<p>
Space between the bill and eye, and around the latter, bare, as is the
lower half of the tibia. Plumage soft, generally loose. Feathers of the
upper and hind part of the head, and of the neck generally, especially on
the sides and at the lower part anteriorly, much elongated very narrow,
loose, with linear compact extremities. The feathers of the back are similar
but broader at their base, and those from the middle of the back
are so elongated as to extend several inches beyond the tail, forming a
train of which the filaments are hair-like and rather stiff. Wings of moderate
length; primaries broad, tapering, the inner broadly rounded, with
an acumen, as are the very broad secondaries; first quill longest, second
almost equal, third and fourth slightly shorter, the rest of the primaries
rapidly graduated; the inner secondaries extend to nearly an inch of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' href='#Page_419'>419</a></span>
tip of the wing, when the latter is closed. Tail very short, slightly
rounded, of twelve rather weak rounded feathers.

smaller.

Young nearly two years old. Plate CCLVI. Fig. 2.
</p>

<p>
The bill is coloured as in the adult, as is the iris, but the feet are
dark olive-green, the soles greenish-yellow. The plumage presents the
same form as in the adult, but is entirely pure white.
</p>

<p>
In this state the bird has been described as a distinct species under
the name of Peale’s Egret Heron, but must now be restored to its proper
species, the adult having been described and figured by <span class="smcap">Buffon</span> under the
name of <i>Aigrette rousse</i>, and named by <span class="smcap">Latham</span> the Reddish Egret.
</p>

<p>
This species may be distinguished at the first glance from all others
that occur in the United States, by the peculiar form of the feathers of
the head and neck, which are loose, pendent, and fringe-like, at all seasons,
excepting in the young bird before the first moult.
</p>

<p>
The number of young, as in all other species, much exceeds that of
adult or coloured birds; and I have procured them in the proportion of
three to one. I carried upwards of fifty specimens of this Heron to
Charleston, where, as well as in Philadelphia, New York, and London, I
presented some to my friends and to public institutions. I also sent several
to my friend <span class="smcap">P. J. Selby</span>, Esq. of Twizel, Northumberland, and lately
gave a pair to the Museum of the University of Edinburgh. Several specimens,
which I presented to His Royal Highness the <span class="smcap">Duke</span> of <span class="smcap">Sussex</span>,
have been by him given to the British Museum.

<p>
The objects that more especially attract the notice of the voyager, as he
draws near the south-west coast of Labrador, are the numerous low islands
covered with countless multitudes of birds, that have assembled there for
the purpose of reproduction. Some miles farther, you see a ridge of craggy
and desolate cliffs, emerging from the sea, and presenting the appearance of
a huge granite wall. This forms a partition between the waters of the great
St Lawrence and many fine harbours hidden here and there behind it,
along with numerous inlets and bays, coves and small creeks, in which
the bark of the adventurer may ride in comparative safety. From the
hoary summit of this bulwark the view is grand beyond description; valleys
richly carpeted with moss and thickets of low shrubs glow in tints of
the richest green; clear blue lakes bear on their bosom numerous birds
of varied wing, while around their margins the females are seated on their
eggs or carefully leading about their young; banks of perennial snow arrest
your eye for a moment, and perhaps produce an involuntary chill;
onward towards the horizon, mountains heaped confusedly behind mountains,
mingle their gloomy tints with those of the cold sky. In that land,
man may for weeks, even months, seek for his kind in vain. The deep
silence that reigns around him during a calm, seldom fails to bring sadness
to his heart, as his eye grows dim with gazing on the wilderness.
Should the northern gale issue from its snowy chambers, darkness follows
in its train, and should its whole fury pour upon you, melancholy
indeed must be your lot.
</p>

<p>
To the low islands above alluded to, the beautiful Cormorant represented
in the plate before you, resorts each spring, for the purpose of
breeding. It arrives from the south about the beginning of May, or as
soon as the waters of the Gulf are sufficiently free of ice to enable it to
procure food. The winter it spends on our eastern coasts, but it rarely
proceeds farther south than the Capes of North Carolina, about which it
meets its southern friend the Florida Cormorant, on whose dominions,
however, it does not venture.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
</p>

<p>
While with us, the Double-crested Cormorants are seen flying in long
lines, sometimes forming angles, and passing low over the water, at no
great distance from the shore. They enter our large bays, rivers and
creeks, going up as far as the tide, but are seldom or never seen fishing
in fresh-water. Their stay along the Middle Districts continues from the
beginning of October to the middle of April; farther east they are seen
a month earlier, and disappear a fortnight later. A good number breed
on the Seal Islands off the Bay of Fundy, but the greater part return to
Labrador and Baffin’s Bay, where Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> found this species.
To that excellent man and intrepid traveller, we are indebted, among
other valuable fruits of his labours, for the first good description of this
bird. From his account and the information which I have received from
Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span>, I believe that it does not go much farther
north than the place where it was observed by the first mentioned traveller;
and no Cormorants were seen during the late voyage to the Arctic circle.
It is probable that neither the Double-crested nor the Florida Cormorants
occur in any part of Europe; at least, if they have been described as
birds of that quarter of the globe, I can find no account sufficiently correct
to enable me to recognise them.
</p>

<p>
A few miles from one of the entrances of the Harbour of Whapatiguan,
is a low and flat island about a mile in length, on which the present species
breeds. As we sailed past it, we could easily observe the birds on their
nests, all over the rock, which was completely white-washed with their excrement,
that emitted a disagreeable odour to a great distance. I had seen
several islands near the Harbour of Great Macatina inhabited by these
Cormorants, but being anxious to complete the examination of one subject
at a time, and knowing that we should see a greater number as we
approach the Straits of Belle Isle, I put off the investigation until I should
have leisure to prosecute it satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
My son, accompanied by the captain and four sailors, sailed for Cormorant
Island, on which, however, they found great difficulty in landing,
for the surf broke so fearfully as to call into requisition all the judgment
and good management of Mr <span class="smcap">Emery</span>. The moment they landed, almost
all the birds of the island rose on wing, darkening the air, and
alighted at some distance on the water in large bodies. They were so shy
that it was not without considerable difficulty that ten of them were obtained.
At the first shot, hundreds of young ones scrambled out of their
nests, and huddled together in packs of fifteen or twenty. When the men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' href='#Page_422'>422</a></span>
approached them, they opened their bills, squeaked, hissed, and puffed in
a most outrageous manner; and the noise produced by the multitudes on
the island was not merely disagreeable, but really shocking. Some of the
nests contained eggs, and the young were of all sizes, from the newly
hatched up to those able to fly; none, however, even of the largest, attempted
to gain the water, but all preferred hiding themselves in the fissures
of the rocks, or behind the nests. It was curious to see them crawl
flat on the rock, assisting themselves with their bill, feet and wings, employing
the first in the manner of Parrots, and the wings like the oars of
a boat or the flappers of turtles. When approached, they curved and
twisted their necks in the most curious manner, reminding one of the
writhings of a snake, and when seized they muted so profusely as to excite
disgust. A dozen or more of different sizes, however, were thrust into a
bag, and carried on board the vessel. The materials and dimensions of
the nests were noted on the spot, and a hatful of eggs was brought to me.
</p>

<p>
The Double-crested Cormorant forms its nest of sea-weeds, some sticks,
moss, and clods of earth, with grass adhering to them, which it piles up
into a solid mass, often as high as three feet from the rock, with a diameter
of fifteen or eighteen inches at the top, and of two and a half feet at
the base. The whole has an appearance of solidity seldom seen in the
nests of water-birds. The nests are placed as near each other as the
nature of the ground will permit, and a great number which appeared to
have stood out against the winter storms, had been enlarged and repaired
that season. Many, however, lay scattered over the rocks, having been
demolished by heavy gales or the breaking of the surf during tempests.
The whole surface of the rock resembled a mass of putridity: feathers,
broken and rotten eggs, and dead young, lay scattered over it; and I
leave you to guess how such a place must smell in a calm warm day. The
eggs are three or four, average two and a half inches in length by one
inch and four and a half eighths in breadth, and have an elongated form.
They are covered with a calcareous coating, which is more or less soiled
with filth, but when carefully scraped, shews a fine light greenish-blue tint.
</p>

<p>
The young when just hatched, are of a bluish-black colour tinged
with purple, and look extremely odd. They remain blind for several
days, and for about a fortnight are fed by the parents with the greatest
care, the food being regurgitated into their open throats. They appear
to grow rapidly, for in the course of eight or ten days we found some the
size of a pullet, which, when marked, were scarcely half that size. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' href='#Page_423'>423</a></span>
are covered with long down of a brownish-black colour, and do not leave
the nest, unless they are intruded on, until they are able to fly, when
their parents, who long before had ceased to feed them by dropping the
fish into their bill, and had merely placed it on the ground near them,
leave them to shift for themselves. By the middle of August all these
birds remove southward, along Newfoundland, by Cape Breton Island,
and the shores of Nova Scotia, scarcely any remaining on the coast of
the first during winter, when indeed not many are seen farther east than
the Bay of Halifax.
</p>

<p>
The fishermen and eggers never gather their eggs, they being unfit
for being eaten by any other animals than Gulls or Jagers; but they
commit great havock among the young, which they salt for food or bait.
The old birds are too shy to be killed in great numbers, otherwise their
feathers, although they smell strongly of fish, might be turned to account.
I have never eaten Cormorant’s flesh, and intend to refrain from tasting
it until nothing better can be procured.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is strong and well sustained, although not
so rapid as that of the Florida Cormorant. It sails at times in a beautiful
manner, and at a great height above the waters. Like other species,
the Double-crested Cormorants are fond of sunning themselves, with their
wings spread out. They walk awkwardly, and cannot run without the
aid of their wings. In order to arise from the water, in which they sink
so as nearly to be covered when swimming, they are obliged to run and
beat the surface for many yards, before they get fairly on wing. Their
food consists of shrimps, lents, capelings, codlings, and other fishes, scarcely
any kind coming amiss unless too strong or of too great a size. Of
the codlings especially they devour vast numbers, they being in astonishing
shoals on the coast of Labrador at the time when the Cormorants
are breeding, and indeed remaining until the departure of the birds, when
they retire to deeper water. I never saw a Cormorant plunge from the
air after its prey, but should be much gratified by such a sight, which,
if we trust compilers, is nothing uncommon; nor have I ever seen a bird
of this species perched on any thing higher than the top of the low island
on which the nest is placed, none having been observed by me on any of
the high rocks on which the common species breeds in America.
</p>

<p>
I have given the figure of a beautiful male in its perfect spring plumage.
This is probably the only representation of the bird yet presented
to the public, and the same remark applies to the Florida Cormorant.

The Double-crested and the Florida Cormorants are very nearly allied,
their forms, and the structure of their plumage, being precisely similar.
There is, however, a very considerable difference in size, as will be seen
on comparing their measurements and average weights as given by me.
The bills are similar in form, but their colours differ, as do those of the
eyelids; but in the breeding season these birds may readily be distinguished
by the temporary tufts or crests behind the eyes, which in <i>P. floridanus</i>
consist of a mere line of single feathers curved downwards, while in <i>P. dilophus</i>
they are of considerable breadth, and composed of about forty recurved
feathers. In the absence of the crests, the difference in size affords the
principal means of distinguishing them.

<span class="smcap"><i>Limosa hudsonica</i>, Swains.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLVIII. Adult Male and Young Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
This species, which is of rare occurrence in any part of the United
States, is scarcely ever found farther south along the coast than the State
of Maryland. I had never seen it in the flesh, until I went to Boston
in 1832, when I found specimens of it in the market late in September.
An old gunner in my employ brought me eight or ten in the course
of a month, but they were all young birds. From one of them my son
drew the figure in the plate. While I was at Pictou Professor <span class="smcap">MacCulloch</span>
presented me with a pair of adult birds in beautiful plumage.
When we were on our way towards Labrador, the fishermen and inhabitants
of the Magdeleine Islands, who gave the name of Curlews to the
Godwits, assured me that this species breeds there in some marshes at the
extremity of the principal island, and that they were in the habit of killing
them as soon as they were able to fly, when they were considered excellent
food. We saw none, however, on our voyage farther north, and
in Labrador and Newfoundland nobody seemed to know them.
</p>

<p>
My young friend <span class="smcap">Thomas MacCulloch</span>, who gave me, in London,
several well-mounted specimens of this species, in the spring of 1835, confirmed
the assertions of the people of the Magdeleine Islands, and informed
me that these birds breed at times on Prince Edward’s Island, from which
they spread along the coast of Nova Scotia, where they remain until very
severe weather comes on, when they suddenly disappear.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to give a good figure of the adult, and that made by my
son will, I hope, be considered faithful by those who are acquainted with
the bird in its autumnal plumage. The adult has been represented as lying
down, in order to shew the difference between this species and the <i>Limosa
melanura</i> of Europe, to which it is allied, but from which it may readily
be distinguished at all periods by the black colour of the inner wing-coverts.
In the European bird these feathers are white, and the species does not
occur in the United States, perhaps not in any part of North America.
The females are rather larger than the males, but nothing is known respecting
the nests or eggs.

In September 1835, I shot, near Edinburgh, a young individual of
<i>Limosa rufa</i>, which I had previously observed for some time. It thrust
its bill into the wet sand in the same manner as the Woodcocks; and I
was much surprised, on taking it up, to see that its bill was perfectly
straight in its whole length. When I opened it, however, in order to
place a little cotton in its throat, a sudden spring-like movement of the
mandibles made them curve upwards. Never having kept birds of this
genus alive, I am unable to say whether the bill be naturally straight or
not.

<h2>
THE HORNED GREBE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Podiceps cornutus</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLIX. Male and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
The period at which this little Grebe makes its first appearance, after
the breeding season, on the waters of the Western States, such as the
Ohio, the Mississippi, and their numerous tributaries, is the beginning of
October, when I have seen them arriving and passing onward on wing at
a considerable height in the air, following the course of the streams. The
generally received idea that birds of this genus perform their migrations
on the water, is extremely absurd. I have already offered some remarks
on this subject, but as too much cannot be said, when an erroneous notion
extensively adopted has to be disproved, I here repeat that I have
seen flocks of Grebes on wing and migrating high in the air, apparently
with as much ease, as many longer-winged birds, and with considerable
velocity.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening, on the 14th of October 1820, I was floating in a
small boat on the Ohio. The weather was perfectly calm, and I was
startled by a whistling sound over head, resembling that of a Hawk stooping
on its prey, when, on looking up, I saw a flock of Grebes, about thirty
in number, gliding towards the water as if about to alight within a quarter
of a mile from me. In a few minutes they had come within a few yards
of the surface of the water, when suddenly checking their speed, they
pursued their course until out of sight; but in a short time I saw them
returning towards me, and in less than a minute they all passed at a distance
of forty or fifty yards, took a round and alighted pell-mell. The
next moment, they were all engaged in washing and trimming themselves,
in the manner of Ducks, Cormorants, and other aquatic birds. As I
rowed towards them, they scarcely took notice of me, so that they were
easily approached; and finding a number of them close together, I fired
and killed four. The rest paddled off for some yards, rose on wing, and
flew down the stream in a pretty close body, looking as if not disposed to
settle again for some time. On picking up the dead birds, I found them
to be of the present species, three being young, the other an adult with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' href='#Page_430'>430</a></span>
the winter plumage beginning to appear. Here I may remark, that Grebes
in general do not moult so early as most other birds after they have young;
thus the Crested Grebe often passes to the south in September, with its
head still adorned with a large portion of the feathers of its spring and
summer tippet. While residing at different places on the Ohio, I have
many times witnessed the passage of the Horned and the Crested.
</p>

<p>
The Horned Grebe is abundant during autumn and winter on the
large rivers or inlets of the Southern States, but rare along the coasts of
the Middle and Eastern Districts. On the rivers about Charleston in
South Carolina it is seen at those seasons in considerable numbers, although
not in larger flocks than from four to seven individuals. The
same is observable from that place to the mouths of the Mississippi. It
is particularly fond of those streams of which the borders are overgrown
by rank sedges and other plants, and are subject to the influx of the tide.
In such places they enjoy greater security while searching for their food,
than in ponds, to which, however, they for the most part retire at the approach
of the pairing season, which commences early in February. At
that time one might be apt to think that these birds could scarcely fly, as
they are then rarely seen on wing; but when they are pursued, and there
happens to be a breeze, they rise from the water with considerable ease,
and fly to a distance of several hundred yards. In December and January
I have never procured any having the least remains of their summer headdress;
but by the 10th of March, when they were on their journey towards
the north, the long feathers of the head were apparent. These
tufts seem to attain their full development in the course of a fortnight or
three weeks, the old birds becoming plumed sooner than the young, some
of which leave the country in their winter dress.
</p>

<p>
On the ground, this species is not better off than the Dobchick, it being
obliged to stand nearly erect, the hind part of the body resting, and
the tarsi and toes extended laterally. They dive with great celerity, and
when once acquainted with the effects of the gun, are not easily shot. A
report is at times sufficient to make the old birds dive at once, although
they may be quite beyond the reach of a shot. The young birds are
more easily procured at their first appearance; but the most efficient method
of obtaining them is to employ fishing nets, in the meshes of which
they become entangled.
</p>

<p>
Excepting a species of Hawk nearly allied to <i>Circus cyaneus</i>, I know
of no other bird that has the eye of such colour, the iris being externally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_431' href='#Page_431'>431</a></span>
of a vivid red, with an inner circle of white, which gives it a very singular
appearance. On attentively examining the eyes of our Divers and Grebes,
I have not found any with similar eyes. The Horned Grebe does not
seem to see better than any other species, nor does it appear to be more
diurnal than the rest, nor are the objects on which it feeds more minute,
for I have found as small seeds in the stomach of the large Grebe as in
that of the present species. The reason of this strange colouring of the
iris, therefore, I am unable to conjecture.
</p>

<p>
Although the greater number of these birds go far northward to breed,
some remain within the limits of the United States during the whole year,
rearing their young on the borders of ponds, particularly in the northern
parts of the State of Ohio, in the vicinity of Lake Erie. Two nests which
I found were placed at a distance of about four yards from the water’s edge,
on the top of broken down tussocks of rank weeds. The materials of which
they were composed were of the same nature, and rudely interwoven to a
height of upwards of seven inches. They were rather more than a foot
in diameter at the base, the cavity only four inches across, shallow, but
more neatly finished with finer plants, of which a quantity lay on the borders,
and was probably used by the bird to cover the eggs when about to
leave them. There were five eggs in one nest, seven in the other; all
contained chicks (on the 29th of July); they measured one inch and three
quarters in length, by one inch and two and a half eighths; their shell
was smooth, and of a uniform yellowish cream colour, without spots or
marks of any kind. The nests were not more than fifty yards apart, on
the south-western side of the pond. I am thus particular because of the
near relation of this bird to the <i>Podiceps auritus</i> of <span class="smcap">Latham</span>, with which
it may be confounded by a not over-careful observer, as may the eggs too,
those of the latter species being precisely of the same length, but fully an
eighth of an inch narrower, which of course gives them a more elongated
appearance. I have observed the same differences in the eggs of these two
species in Europe. I could not ascertain if both the parent birds incubate;
but as I saw two pairs on the pond, I am inclined to think that they do.
The nests were not fastened to the weeds around them, nor do I conceive
it probable that they could be floated, as various writers assert they are
at times.
</p>

<p>
I have not seen the young of this species when small; but from the
knowledge I have of those of other Grebes, I feel pretty certain that the
notions entertained of their being carried either on the back or under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' href='#Page_432'>432</a></span>
wings of their parents in cases of danger must be erroneous, as Grebes in
all such cases dive or fly at once, when it would be impossible for the
old and young to keep thus attached to each other.
</p>

<p>
I have observed in the stomachs of almost all that I have examined,
a quantity of hair-like substances rolled together like the pellets of owls,
but have not ascertained whether or not these masses are disgorged. They
certainly cannot pass through the intestines. But unless birds of this
kind are kept in an aviary and watched, this matter must remain unknown.
The food of this species, while on salt-water, is composed of shrimps,
small fishes, and minute crustacea. While on fresh-water, they procure
insects, leeches, small frogs, tadpoles, and aquatic lizards; they also pick
up the seeds of grasses, and I have found as many in the stomach of an
individual as would fill the shell of one of its eggs. Their flight is performed
by regular short flappings, executed with great quickness.
</p>

<p>
I have represented an adult male in full spring plumage, and a young
bird shot in December. The males are rather larger than the females,
which are similar in colour, but rarely have the head so well feathered
during the breeding season.

<h2>
THE FORKED-TAILED PETREL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Thalassidroma Leachii</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
Before describing the habits of this bird, I think it necessary to speak
of three distinct species which are at times found near our coasts, and of
which I have found two breeding within the Union. The present species
is the largest; that named after <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> the next in size; and the one
called the Stormy Petrel the least. Until I had met with the whole of
these species near our coast, I, like others, thought that the last mentioned
kept nearer to Europe than it in reality does at certain seasons.
</p>

<p>
In August 1831, I was on board of the American packet-ship the Columbia,
commanded by my friend <span class="smcap">Joseph Delano</span>, Esq. who had promised
that, in case of a calm occurring, he would allow me to have a boat manned
to go in search of birds. The day is not given, because I never keep a journal
while crossing the Atlantic; but as I had left England on the first of
the month, and was then on the banks of Newfoundland, it must have
been towards the latter part of it, when the weather suddenly became quite
calm and beautiful. “Mother Carey’s Chickens” were by hundreds around
the noble ship, and although ill in consequence of the sickness which
never leaves me at sea, I asked for a boat and some hands to row me
about for an hour or so. This was granted, guns and ammunition were
placed in the yawl, and my assistant Mr <span class="smcap">Henry Ward</span> of London, an
officer, and two sailors, accompanied me. We had three guns which were
alternately loaded and handed to me. In the course of about an hour
twenty-five or thirty Petrels were shot, together with some Fulmars. Had
you been looking on, you might perhaps have laughed at me on seeing
that the moment after I fired, I was obliged to lean over the side of the
bark to relieve myself from the distressing state of my stomach. On returning
to the ship, my companions nimbly ascended the chains; but although
when on land I am pretty firm and active, I was now quite unfit
for service, and therefore was hoisted in a chair. Once on deck, I laid
myself down on a mattress, my wife attended to me, and I gradually became
relieved, as the ship stood, to use the words of my kind captain,
“as still as if on the stocks.” There were the dead birds nicely arranged
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' href='#Page_435'>435</a></span>
on a board by my side; the wounded ones were placed in a cage, and I
began to examine them all with care. To my great surprise, I found
among them all the three species mentioned above. Sixteen of these birds
were beautifully prepared by Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span>, and the rest were placed in
spirits, after I had made correct outlines of each species, and taken their
exact dimensions and weight. The drawings, however, I was unable to
finish on account of the giddiness, which seldom leaves me while at sea.
The calm continued the whole of the next day, and, laying myself down
on the top of the round-house, I had ample opportunities of observing the
habits of the three species, while thus at a distance from land.
</p>

<p>
My esteemed friend the Prince of Musignano has stated that the
Forked-tailed Petrel is less numerous near the American coast than the
species named after <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>. It is true that it rarely goes so far south,
but in the vicinity of Massachusetts, and from thence to Newfoundland, it
is by far the most abundant of the two; and it breeds on all suitable places
from the Islands of Mount Desert to the last mentioned country.
</p>

<p>
The species of this genus with which I am acquainted all ramble over
the seas, both by night and by day, until the breeding season commences,
when they remain in their burrows, under rocks, or in their fissures, until
towards sunset, when they start off in search of food, returning to their
mates or young in the morning, and feeding them then. I feel pretty
confident that these birds, like Owls, can hold out against hunger for
many hours, and are satisfied with one abundant meal in the day. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>
was of a different opinion, but I believe he never found these birds
breeding.
</p>

<p>
The Forked-tailed Petrel emits its notes night and day, and at not
very long intervals, although it is less noisy than <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s Petrel. They
resemble the syllables <i>pewr-wit</i>, <i>pewr-wit</i>. Its flight differs from that of
the other two species, it being performed in broader wheelings, and with
firmer flappings, in which respect it resembles that of the Night Hawk,
<i>Caprimulgus virginianus</i>, while that bird is passing low over the meadows
or the waters. It is more shy than the other species, and when it
wheels off after having approached the stern of a ship, its wanderings are
much more extended before it returns. I have never seen it fly close
around a vessel, as the others are in the habit of doing, especially at the
approach of night; nor do I think that it ever alights on the rigging of
ships, but spends the hours of darkness either on the water, or on low
rocks or islands. It also less frequently alights on the water, or pats it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>436</a></span>
with its feet, probably on account of the shortness of its legs, although it
frequently allows them to hang down. In this it resembles the <i>Thalassidroma
pelagica</i>, and <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s Petrel has a similar habit during calm
weather. I have seen all the three species immerse their head into the water,
to seize their food, and sometimes keep it longer under than I had expected.
</p>

<p>
About the first of June, the species separate, collect in numbers, and
return to their breeding places. I state so from the report of persons on
whose testimony I can rely, and who have assured me that, like the Guillemots,
they revisit their haunts each spring for years in succession. They
now fly in front of the high rocks, in the manner of our Purple Martin
when it first arrives at its well known box, passing and repassing a thousand
times in the day, enter their dark and narrow mansions, or stand in
the passage, and emit their cries, as the bird just mentioned is wont to do
on similar occasions. Now they alight on some broad shelf, and walk as
if about to fall down, but with considerable ease, and at times with rapidity.
Now and then the mated birds approach each other, and, I believe,
disgorge some food into each other’s mouths, although I am not absolutely
certain that they do so, having only observed them at such times
by means of a glass. They collect grasses and pebbles, of which they form
a flat nest, on which a single white egg is deposited, which measures an
inch and a quarter in length, by seven-eighths in breadth, is nearly equally
rounded at both ends, and looks very large for the size of the bird.
When boiled, it has a musky smell, but is palatable. When you pass
close to the rocks in which they are, you easily hear their shrill querulous
notes; but the report of a gun silences them at once, and induces those
on the ledges to betake themselves to their holes.
</p>

<p>
The Forked-tailed Petrel, like the other species, feeds chiefly on floating
mollusca, small fishes, crustacea, which they pick up among the floating
sea-weeds, and greasy substances, which they occasionally find around
fishing-boats or ships out at sea. When seized in the hand, it ejects an
oily fluid through the tubular nostrils, and sometimes disgorges a quantity
of food. I could not prevail on any of those which I had caught to take
food.
</p>

<p>
These birds are caught from the sterns of vessels, with long slender
threads, the manner of using which I shall describe when I come to speak
of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s Petrel. I never could entice one of them to swallow a hook.
Very few are found on the coasts of England or Scotland, where, however,
the species is said to breed.

<h2>
A MAPLE-SUGAR CAMP.
</h2>

<p>
While advancing the best way I could through the magnificent woods
that cover the undulating grounds in the vicinity of the Green River in
Kentucky, I was overtaken by night. With slow and cautious steps I
proceeded, feeling some doubt as to my course, when the moon came
forth, as if purposely to afford me her friendly light. The air I thought
was uncommonly keen, and the gentle breeze that now and then shook
the tops of the tall trees, more than once made me think of halting for the
night, and forming a camp. At times I thought of the campaigns of my
old friend <span class="smcap">Daniel Boon</span>, his strange adventures in these very woods, and
the extraordinary walk which he performed to save his fellow-creatures at
Fort Massacre from the scalping knives of the irritated Indians. Now
and then a racoon or opossum, causing the fallen leaves to rustle, made
me pause for a moment; and thus I was forcing my way, thinking on
many things dismal as well as pleasing, when the glimmer of a distant
fire suddenly roused me from my reveries, and inspired me with fresh
animation. As I approached it, I observed forms of different kinds moving
to and fro before it, like spectres; and ere long, bursts of laughter, shouts,
and songs apprised me of some merrymaking. I thought at first that I
had probably stumbled upon a camp-meeting; but I soon perceived that
the mirth proceeded from a band of sugar-makers. Every man, woman,
and child stared as I passed them, but all were friendly, and, without
more ceremony than was needful, I walked up to the fire, at which I
found two or three old women, with their husbands, attending to the
kettles. Their plain dresses of Kentucky homespun were far more pleasing
to my sight than the ribboned turbans of city dames, or the powdered
wigs and embroidered waistcoats of antique beaux. I was heartily welcomed,
and supplied with a goodly pone of bread, a plate of molasses, and
some sweet potatoes.
</p>

<p>
Fatigued with my long ramble, I lay down under the lee of the smoke,
and soon fell into a sound sleep. When day returned, the frost lay thick
around; but the party arose cheerful and invigorated, and after performing
their orisons, resumed their labour. The scenery around was most
pleasing; the ground all round looked as if it had been cleared of underwood;
the maples, straight and tall, seemed as if planted in rows; between
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_439' href='#Page_439'>439</a></span>
them meandered several rills, which gently murmured as they hastened
toward the larger stream; and as the sun dissolved the frozen dews,
the few feathered songsters joined the chorus of the woodsmen’s daughters.
Whenever a burst of laughter suddenly echoed through the woods,
an Owl or Wild Turkey would respond to it, with a signal welcome to
the young men of the party. With large ladles the sugar-makers stirred
the thickening juice of the maple; pails of sap were collected from the
trees and brought in by the young people; while here and there some
sturdy fellow was seen first hacking a cut in a tree, and afterwards boring
with an auger a hole, into which he introduced a piece of hollow cane, by
which the sap was to be drained off. About half a dozen men had felled
a noble yellow poplar, and sawed its great trunk into many pieces, which,
after being split, they were scooping into troughs to be placed under the
cane-cocks, to receive the maple juice.
</p>

<p>
Now, good Reader, should you ever chance to travel through the
maple grounds that lie near the banks of that lovely stream the Green
River of Kentucky, either in January or in March, or through those on
the broader Monongahela in April; nay, should you find yourself by the
limpid streamlets that roll down the declivities of the Pocano Mountains
to join the Lehigh, and there meet with a sugar-camp, take my advice
and tarry for a while. If you be on foot or on horseback, and are thirsty,
you can nowhere find a more wholesome or more agreeable beverage than
the juice of the maple. A man when in the Floridas may drink molasses
diffused in water; in Labrador he may drink what he can get; and at
New York or Philadelphia he may drink what he chooses; but in the
woods a draught from the sugar-maple is delicious and most refreshing.
How often, when travelling, have I quenched my thirst with the limpid
juice of the receiving troughs, from which I parted with regret; nay,
even my horse, I have thought, seemed to desire to linger as long as he
could.
</p>

<p>
But let me endeavour to describe to you the manner in which the sugar
is obtained. The trees that yield it (<i>Acer saccharinum</i>) are found more
or less abundantly in all parts of the Union from Louisiana to Maine, growing
on elevated rich grounds. An incision is made into the trunk, at a height
of from two to six feet; a pipe of cane or of any other kind is thrust into
the aperture; a trough is placed beneath and receives the juice, which
trickles by drops, and is as limpid as the purest spring water. When all the
trees of a certain space have been tapped, and the troughs filled, the people
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_440' href='#Page_440'>440</a></span>
collect the juice, and pour it into large vessels. A camp has already
been pitched in the midst of a grove, several iron boilers have been fixed
on stone or brick supports, and the business proceeds with vigour. At times
several neighbouring families join, and enjoy the labour as if it were a past-time,
remaining out day and night for several weeks; for the troughs and
kettles must be attended to from the moment when they are first put in
requisition until the sugar is produced. The men and boys perform the
most laborious part of the business, but the women and girls are not less
busy.
</p>

<p>
It takes ten gallons of sap to produce a pound of fine-<i>grained sugar</i>;
but an inferior kind in lumps, called <i>cake-sugar</i>, is obtained in greater
quantity. When the season is far advanced, the juice will no longer
grain by boiling, and only produces a syrup. I have seen maple sugar
so good, that some months after it was manufactured it resembled candy;
and well do I remember the time when it was an article of commerce
throughout Kentucky, where, twenty-five or thirty years ago, it sold at
from
<span class="mixfract">6&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> to
<span class="mixfract">12&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> cents per pound, according to its quality, and was daily
purchased in the markets or stores.
</p>

<p>
Trees that have been thus bored rarely last many years; for the cuts
and perforations made in their trunks injure their health, so that after
some years of <i>weeping</i> they become sickly, exhibit monstrosities about
their lower parts, gradually decay, and at length die. I have no doubt,
however, that, with proper care, the same quantity of sap might be obtained
with less injury to the trees; and it is now fully time that the farmers
and land-owners should begin to look to the preservation of their
sugar-maples.

On referring to one of my journals, written on the Gulf of Mexico, I
find it stated that one of these birds came on board one dark night, and,
after passing the man at the helm, fell into the yawl hanging at the stern
of the ship, where in the morning it was discovered and secured. Although
to appearance in good health, it refused every kind of food, and
in a few days died. Knowing the great power of flight of this species, I
could only conjecture that some disease operating powerfully at the moment,
had caused the bird to take refuge in the boat.

<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXIII. Adult and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
In the course of my extensive rambles along our coasts and in the interior,
I have seen only three birds of this species, all of which I have
kept with care, considering the Cape Sandpiper or Pigmy Curlew as the
rarest of its genus with us. It appears to resort to particular districts;
two of my birds were shot at Great Egg Harbour in New Jersey, in the
spring of 1829, the other on Long Island near Sandy Hook. No other
birds were near them, and I approached them without much difficulty.
They were wading along the shores up to the knees, picking up floating
garbage and sand worms. In their stomachs I found fragments of minute
shells, slender red worms, and bits of marine plants. The one
killed on Long Island was a fine male in full plumage, and from it I
made the figure that has been engraved in the plate. The others were
females or young birds of the preceding year. One, in plain plumage,
was drawn; the other, mottled beneath with patches of white and dull
rufous, I considered as a female which might perhaps have perfected its
colouring that season. I have seen a few specimens in New York, and
two in Boston; and my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span> has one or two in his
possession.

<h2>
THE FULMAR PETREL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Procellaria glacialis</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXIV. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Though not a large bird, the Fulmar is possessed of considerable
strength, and has a powerful and sustained flight. In autumn and winter
it is seen on our eastern coasts, from which it retires early in summer,
to betake itself to the northern retreats in which it rears its young. I
have never seen it farther south than Long Island, but I have often found
it on the banks of Newfoundland, and in the space intervening between
them and our shores. From the beginning of September to that of May
it may be said to be pretty common, especially around the banks, to which
the cod-fishers resort, and where it feeds chiefly on the rejected garbage.
</p>

<p>
One calm day in August, when on a voyage from England to New York,
of which I have already spoken when describing the Forked-tailed Petrel,
I procured several Fulmars. They came up and alighted near the boat,
whenever we threw any thing overboard, and did not seem to be in the
least alarmed by the report of a gun. In one instance I shot one on the
water, when it was so near that I could distinctly see the colour of its eye.
A great number of them were swimming in small detached flocks of eight
or ten, their colour at a distance appearing as if pure white, and contrasting
beautifully with the dark blue of the sea. They floated very
buoyantly, some swimming about with great ease, others to appearance
sound asleep. Most of them had the wing and tail feathers ragged, and
some were much soiled with greasy matter, which gave them an unpleasant
appearance. Those which were caught, on being wounded, emitted
quantities of oily matter by their nostrils, and disgorged much of the
same substance; but did not attempt to bite, which seemed strange in
birds having the bill so powerful and hooked. They fly with less grace
than the Shearwaters, proceeding in a direct line, and at a small height,
towards the objects on which they feed.
</p>

<p>
I was much disappointed at not finding the Fulmar along the rocky
shores of Labrador, where I had expected to meet with it, as it is regularly
observed in spring moving northward in files opposite the entrance
of the Straits of Belle Isle. Its passage towards the Arctic Regions has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_447' href='#Page_447'>447</a></span>
been observed by Captain <span class="smcap">Sabine</span> on the coast of Greenland. “Whilst
the ships,” he says, “were detained by the ice in Jacob’s Bay, in latitude
71°, from the 24th of June to the 3d of July, Fulmars were passing in a
continual stream to the northward, in numbers inferior only to the flight
of the Passenger Pigeon in America.” While on my way to Labrador,
I was told that they bred on the Seal Islands off the entrance of the Bay
of Fundy. The egg, which is of a regular ovate form, with a smooth
brittle pure white shell, measures two inches and seven-eighths in length,
by two inches in breadth.
</p>

<p>
My much esteemed friend Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span>, in his Illustrations of British
Ornithology, gives the following account of this species. “The steep and
rocky St Kilda, one of the western islands of Scotland, is the only locality
within the British dominions annually resorted to by the Fulmar, the rest
of the Scottish and our more southern coasts being rarely visited even by
stragglers. Upon St Kilda these birds are found in vast numbers during
the spring and summer months, breeding in the caverns and holes of the
rocks; and, from the various uses to which the down, feathers, and oil of
the young are applied, contribute essentially to the comfort of the inhabitants.
They lay but one egg each, white, and of a large size, with a shell
of very brittle texture. The young are hatched about the middle of June,
and are fed with <i>oil</i> thrown up by the parents (the produce of the food
upon which they subsist), and, as soon as fledged, are eagerly sought for
by the natives, although often at the risk of life, in scaling the tremendous
and overhanging cliffs in which they nestle. Like most of the group,
these birds have the power of ejecting oil with much force through their
tubular nostrils, which is used as the principal mode of defence; it becomes
an essential point, therefore, that they should be taken and killed
by surprise, in order to prevent the loss of a liquid so requisite for the
comfort of the inhabitants, by supplying them with the necessary fuel for
their lamps. The Fulmar is of voracious appetite, feeding upon all sorts
of animal substance, particularly of an oily nature, such as the blubber of
whales, seals, &amp;c.; and for this purpose it follows in great numbers the
track of the whale vessels, and is so greedy of its favourite food, as to be
often seen alighting upon the wounded animal, when not quite dead, and
immediately proceeding to break the skin with its strong hooked bill, and
gorging itself with the blubber to repletion.”
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Mr <span class="smcap">Scoresby</span>, in his “Arctic Regions,” vol. i. p. 528, gives
the following account of its habits as observed by him in the polar seas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' href='#Page_448'>448</a></span>
</p>

<p>
“The Fulmar is the constant companion of the whale-fisher. It joins
his ship immediately on passing the Shetland Islands, and accompanies it
through the trackless ocean to the highest accessible latitudes. It keeps
an eager watch for any thing thrown overboard; the smallest particle of
fatty substance can scarcely escape it. As such, a hook baited with a
piece of fat meat or blubber, and towed by a long twine over the ship’s
stern, is a means employed by the sailor boys for taking them. In the
spring of the year, before they have glutted themselves too frequently
with the fat of the whale, they may be eaten; and when cleared of the
skin, and of every particle of yellow fatty substance lying beneath it, and
well soaked in water, they are pretty good, particularly in ‘sea pies.’
They are remarkably easy and swift on the wing. They can fly to windward
in the highest storms, and rest on the water with great composure
in the most tremendous seas. But it is observed that, in heavy gales,
they fly extremely low, generally skimming along by the surface of the
water. The Fulmar walks awkwardly, and with the legs so bent that the
feet almost touch the belly. When on ice it rests with its body on the
surface, and presents its breast to the wind. Like the Duck, it sometimes
turns its head backward, and conceals its bill beneath its wing.
</p>

<p>
“Fulmars are extremely greedy of the fat of the whale. Though few
should be seen when a whale is about being captured, yet, as soon as the
flensing process commences, they rush in from all quarters, and frequently
accumulate to many thousands in number. They then occupy the
greasy track of the ship; and being audaciously greedy, fearlessly advance
within a few yards of the men employed in cutting up the whale. If, indeed,
the fragments of fat do not float sufficiently away, they approach so
near the scene of operations, that they are knocked down with boat hooks
in great numbers, and sometimes taken up by the hand. The sea immediately
about the ship’s stern, is sometimes so completely covered with
them, that a stone can scarcely be thrown overboard, without striking one
of them. When any thing is thus cast among them, those nearest the
spot where it falls take the alarm, and these exciting some fear in others
more remote, sometimes put a thousand of them in motion; but as, in
rising into the air, they assist their wings, for the first few yards, by
striking the water with their feet, there is produced by such a number of
them, a loud and most singular splashing. It is highly amusing to observe
the voracity with which they seize the pieces of fat that fall in their
way; the size and quantity of the pieces they take at a meal; the curious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' href='#Page_449'>449</a></span>
chuckling noise which in their anxiety for dispatch they always make;
and the jealousy with which they view, and the boldness with which
they attack, any of this species that are engaged in devouring the finest
morsels. They frequently glut themselves so completely, that they are
unable to fly; in which case, when they are not relieved by a quantity
being disgorged, they endeavour to get on the nearest piece of ice, where
they rest until the advancement of digestion restores their wonted powers.
Then, if opportunity admit, they return with the same gust to the banquet
as before; and though numbers of the species may be killed, and
allowed to float about among them, they appear unconscious of danger to
themselves.
</p>

<p>
“The Fulmar never dives, but when incited to it by the appearance
of a morsel of fat under water. When in close view of any men, it keeps
a continual watch both on the men and its prey; having its feet continually
in motion, and yet perhaps not moving at all through the water.
Its boldness increases with the numbers of its species that surround it.
It is a very hardy bird. Its feathers being thick it is not easily killed with
a blow. Its bite, from the crookedness, strength, and sharpness of its bill,
is very severe.
</p>

<p>
“When carrion is scarce, the Fulmars follow the living whale; and
sometimes, by their peculiar motions, when hovering at the surface of the
water, point out to the fisher the position of the animal of which he is in
pursuit. They cannot make much impression on the dead whale, until
some more powerful animal tears away the skin; the epidermis and rete
mucosum they entirely remove, but the true skin is too tough for them
to make way through it.”

company with the Pectoral Sandpiper, and is not uncommon in the
market there. To my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Yarrell</span> I am indebted for the use
of his specimen, from which I made the figure in the act of starting on
wing. The other figure was taken from an American specimen, procured
at Boston, and now in my possession. I regret, however, that I can
say nothing respecting the habits or haunts of this bird, farther than
that having seen a wing of it in the possession of my friend Captain
<span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span>, I think it probable that it breeds near the Arctic
circle, as he received a wing from the sailors, who had found it in the
course of one of the numerous inland excursions in the desolate regions
from which these intrepid navigators have recently returned.

<h2>
THE OPOSSUM.
</h2>

<p>
This singular animal is found more or less abundant in most parts of
the Southern, Western, and Middle States of the Union. It is the <i>Didelphis
virginiana</i> of <span class="smcap">Pennant</span>, <span class="smcap">Harlan</span>, and other authors who have given
some account of its habits; but as none of them, so far as I know, have
illustrated its propensity to dissimulate, and as I have had opportunities
of observing its manners, I trust that a few particulars of its biography
will prove amusing.
</p>

<p>
The opossum is fond of secluding itself during the day, although it by
no means confines its predatory rangings to the night. Like many other
quadrupeds which feed principally on flesh, it is also both frugivorous and
herbivorous, and, when very hard pressed by hunger, it seizes various
kinds of insects and reptiles. Its gait, while travelling, and at a time
when it supposes itself unobserved, is altogether ambling: in other words,
it, like a young foal, moves the two legs of one side forward at once.
The Newfoundland dog manifests a similar propensity. Having a constitution
as hardy as that of the most northern animals, it stands the coldest
weather, and does not hybernate, although its covering of fur and hair
may be said to be comparatively scanty even during winter. The defect,
however, seems to be compensated by a skin of considerable thickness, and
a general subcutaneous layer of fat. Its movements are usually rather
slow, and as it walks or ambles along, its curious prehensile tail is carried
just above the ground, its rounded ears are directed forward, and at almost
every step its pointed nose is applied to the objects beneath it in
order to discover what sort of creatures may have crossed its path. Methinks
I see one at this moment slowly and cautiously trudging over the
melting snows by the side of an unfrequented pond, nosing as it goes for
the fare its ravenous appetite prefers. Now it has come upon the fresh
track of a grouse or hare, and it raises its snout and snuffs the keen air.
At length it has decided on its course, and it speeds onward at the rate of
a man’s ordinary walk. It stops and seems at a loss in what direction to
go, for the object of its pursuit has either taken a considerable leap, or
has cut backwards before the opossum entered its track. It raises itself up,
stands for a while on its hind feet, looks around, snuffs the air again, and
then proceeds; but now, at the foot of a noble tree, it comes to a full
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' href='#Page_455'>455</a></span>
stand. It walks round the base of the huge trunk, over the snow-covered
roots, and among them finds an aperture, which it at once enters. Several
minutes elapse, when it re-appears, dragging along a squirrel already
deprived of life, with which in its mouth it begins to ascend the tree.
Slowly it climbs. The first fork does not seem to suit it, for perhaps it
thinks it might there be too openly exposed to the view of some wily foe,
and so it proceeds, until it gains a cluster of branches intertwined with
grape-vines, and there composing itself, it twists its tail round one of the
twigs, and with its sharp teeth demolishes the unlucky squirrel, which it
holds all the while with its fore paws.
</p>

<p>
The pleasant days of spring have arrived, and the trees vigorously
shoot forth their buds; but the opossum is almost bare, and seems nearly
exhausted by hunger. It visits the margins of creeks, and is pleased to
see the young frogs, which afford it a tolerable repast. Gradually the
poke-berry and the nettle shoot up, and on their tender and juicy stems
it gladly feeds. The matin calls of the Wild Turkey Cock delight the
ear of the cunning creature, for it well knows that it will soon hear the
female, and trace her to her nest, when it will suck the eggs with delight.
Travelling through the woods, perhaps on the ground, perhaps aloft, from
tree to tree, it hears a cock crow, and its heart swells as it remembers the
savoury food on which it regaled itself last summer in the neighbouring
farm-yard. With great care, however, it advances, and at last conceals
itself in the very hen-house.
</p>

<p>
Honest farmer! why did you kill so many crows last winter? aye,
and ravens too? Well, you have had your own way of it; but now hie
to the village and procure a store of ammunition, clean your rusty gun,
set your traps, and teach your lazy curs to watch the opossum. There
it comes! The sun is scarcely down, but the appetite of the prowler is
keen; hear the screams of one of your best chickens that has been seized
by him! The cunning beast is off with it, and nothing now can be done,
unless you stand there to watch the fox or the owl, now exulting in the
thought that you have killed their enemy and your own friend, the poor
crow. That precious hen under which you last week placed a dozen eggs
or so, is now deprived of them. The opossum, notwithstanding her angry
outcries and rufflings of feathers, has removed them one by one; and now,
look at the poor bird as she moves across your yard; if not mad, she is at
least stupid, for she scratches here and there, calling to her chickens all
the while. All this comes from your shooting crows. Had you been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' href='#Page_456'>456</a></span>
more merciful or more prudent, the opossum might have been kept within
the woods, where it would have been satisfied with a squirrel, a young
hare, the eggs of a Turkey, or the grapes that so profusely adorn the
boughs of our forest trees. But I talk to you in vain.
</p>

<p>
There cannot be a better exemplification of maternal tenderness than
the female oppossum. Just peep into that curious sack in which the
young are concealed, each attached to a teat. The kind mother not only
nourishes them with care, but preserves them from their enemies; she
moves with them as the shark does with its progeny, and now, aloft on
the tulip tree, she hides among the thick foliage. By the end of two
months they begin to shift for themselves; each has been taught its particular
lesson, and must now practise it.
</p>

<p>
But suppose the farmer has surprised an Opossum in the act of killing
one of his best fowls. His angry feelings urge him to kick the poor
beast, which, conscious of its inability to resist, rolls off like a ball. The
more the farmer rages, the more reluctant is the animal to manifest resentment;
at last there it lies, not dead, but exhausted, its jaws open, its
tongue extended, its eye dimmed; and there it would lie until the bottle-fly
should come to deposit its eggs, did not its tormentor at length walk
off. “Surely,” says he to himself, “the beast must be dead.” But no,
reader, it is only “’possuming,” and no sooner has its enemy withdrawn,
than it gradually gets on its legs, and once more makes for the woods.
</p>

<p>
Once, while descending the Mississippi, in a sluggish flat-bottomed
boat, expressly for the purpose of studying those objects of nature more
nearly connected with my favourite pursuits, I chanced to meet with two
well-grown Opossums, and brought them alive to the “ark.” The poor
things were placed on the roof or deck, and were immediately assailed by
the crew, when, following their natural instinct, they lay as if quite dead.
An experiment was suggested, and both were thrown overboard. On
striking the water, and for a few moments after, neither evinced the least
disposition to move; but finding their situation desperate, they began to
swim towards our uncouth rudder, which was formed of a long slender
tree, extending from the middle of the boat thirty feet beyond its stern.
They both got upon it, were taken up, and afterwards let loose in their
native woods.
</p>

<p>
In the year 1829, I was in a portion of Lower Louisiana, where the
Opossum abounds at all seasons, and having been asked by the President
and the Secretary of the Zoological Society of London, to forward live
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_457' href='#Page_457'>457</a></span>
animals of this species to them, I offered a price a little above the common,
and soon found myself plentifully supplied, twenty-five having been
brought to me. I found them excessively voracious, and not less cowardly.
They were put into a large box, with a great quantity of food, and
conveyed to a steamer bound for New Orleans. Two days afterwards, I
went to the city, to see about sending them off to Europe; but, to my
surprise, I found that the old males had destroyed the younger ones,
and eaten off their heads, and that only sixteen remained alive. A separate
box was purchased for each, and some time after they reached my
friends the <span class="smcap">Rathbones</span> of Liverpool, who, with their usual attention,
sent them off to London, where, on my return, I saw a good number of
them in the Zoological Gardens.
</p>

<p>
This animal is fond of grapes, of which a species now bears its name.
Persimons are greedily eaten by it, and in severe weather I have observed
it eating lichens. Fowls of every kind, and quadrupeds less
powerful than itself, are also its habitual prey.
</p>

<p>
The flesh of the Opossum resembles that of a young pig, and would
perhaps be as highly prized, were it not for the prejudice generally entertained
against it. Some “very particular” persons, to my knowledge,
have pronounced it excellent eating. After cleaning its body, suspend
it for a whole week in the frosty air, for it is not eaten in summer; then
place it on a heap of hot wood embers; sprinkle it when cooked with
gunpowder; and now tell me, good reader, does it not equal the famed
Canvas-back Duck? Should you visit any of our markets, you may see
it there in company with the best game.

THE COMMON CORMORANT.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXVI. Male, Female, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
Look at the birds before you, and mark the affectionate glance of the
mother, as she stands beside her beloved younglings! I wish you could
have witnessed the actions of such groups as I did while in Labrador.
Methinks I still see the high rolling billows of the St Lawrence breaking
in foaming masses against the huge cliffs, on the shelves of which the
Cormorant places its nest. I lie flat on the edge of the precipice some
hundred feet above the turbulent waters, and now crawling along with all
care, I find myself only a few yards above the spot on which the parent
bird and her young are fondling each other, quite unconscious of my
being near. How delighted I am to witness their affectionate gratulations,
hear their lisping notes, mark the tremulous motions of their expanded
throats, and the curious vacillations of their heads and necks!
The kind mother gently caresses each alternately with her bill; the little
ones draw nearer to her, and, as if anxious to evince their gratitude, rub
their heads against hers. How pleasing all this is to me! But at this
moment the mother accidentally looks upward, her keen eye has met mine,
she utters a croak, spreads her sable wings, and in terror launches into
the air, leaving her brood at my mercy. Far and near, above and beneath
me, the anxious parent passes and repasses; her flight is now unnatural,
and she seems crippled, for she would fain perform those actions
in the air, which other birds perform on the ground or on the water, in such
distressing moments of anxiety for the fate of their beloved young. Her
many neighbours, all as suspicious as herself, well understand the meaning
of her mode of flight, and one after another take to wing, so that the
air is in a manner blackened with them. Some fly far over the waters,
others glide along the face of the bold rock, but none that have observed
me realight, and how many of those there are I am pretty certain, as the
greater number follow in the track of the one most concerned. Meanwhile
the little ones, in their great alarm, have crawled into a recess, and
there they are huddled together. I have witnessed their pleasures and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_459' href='#Page_459'>459</a></span>
their terrors, and now, crawling backwards, I leave them to resume their
ordinary state of peaceful security.
</p>

<p>
It was on the 3d of July 1833, about three in the morning, that I
had the pleasure of witnessing the scene described above. I was aware
before that a colony of Cormorants had nestled on the ledges of the great
rocky wall that separated our harbour of Whapatiguan from the waters
of the Gulf of St Lawrence. A strong gale had ruffled the sea, and the
waves dashed with extreme violence against the rocks, to which circumstance,
I believe, was owing my having remained a while unseen and
unheard so near the birds, which were not more than four or five yards
below me. The mother fondled and nursed her young with all possible
tenderness, disgorged some food into the mouth of each, and coaxed them
with her bill and wings. The little ones seemed very happy, billed with
their mother, and caressed her about the breast. When the parent bird
flew off on observing me, the young seemed quite frightened, squatted at
once on their broad nest, and then crawled with the aid of their bills until
they reached a recess where they remained concealed.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, my young friends <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> and <span class="smcap">Cooledge</span>,
along with my son, went to the same rocks, for the purpose of bringing
me a nest and some of the young Cormorants. They reported that, in
one instance, they surprised the parent birds close beneath them, apparently
asleep, resting on their rumps in an upright position, with the head
thrust under the wing, and that, had they had a noose attached to their
poles, they might have secured at least one of them, but that after a few
minutes one drew out her head, stretched her neck, and after looking
around flew off croaking, so as to alarm all her neighbours.
</p>

<p>
We saw no nests of this species placed in any other situations than
the highest shelves of the precipitous rocks fronting the water and having
a southern exposure. No other Cormorants bred on the spots of which
this kind had taken possession; but Ravens and Peregrine Falcons were
observed to have nests on the same rocks, and in some instances close to
them. The nests were formed of a quantity of small dry sticks, matted
in a rude manner with a large quantity of weeds and moss, to a thickness
of four or five inches in new nests, and in others to that of a foot or more;
for we observed that this species, as well as the Double-crested and the
Florida Cormorants, repair and enlarge their tenements each season, and
return to the same rocks many years in succession, as was shewn by their
places of resort remaining whitewashed with excrements through the winter,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_460' href='#Page_460'>460</a></span>
in which condition we saw them previous to the arrival of the birds
that season. The nests varied in breadth according to the space on which
they were placed; where there was ample room, they measured at the
base from thirty to thirty-six inches in diameter; others were scarcely
large enough to hold the young, which nevertheless seemed as contented
as their neighbours. On some shelves, eight or ten yards in extent, the
nests were crowded together; but more usually they were placed apart
on every secure place without any order; none, however, were below a
certain height on the rocks, nor were there any on the summit. The nests
being covered with filth, were offensive to the eye, and still more so to the
nose. The eggs, three or four in number, more frequently the former,
average two inches and five-eighths in length, by one inch and three quarters
in breadth, the shell of a uniform pale bluish-green colour, mostly
coated over with calcareous matter.
</p>

<p>
The young are at first of a dark purplish livid colour, and have a
very uncouth appearance, their legs and feet seeming enormous. In less
than a fortnight they become covered on all the upper parts with brownish-black
down, but the abdomen remains bare much longer than the
rest. They increase rapidly in size, and are fledged in six or seven
weeks. Some that were weighed when about a month old, averaged three
pounds, and others almost able to fly six pounds, the young of this species,
as of most water birds, being much heavier than the parent at
the time of leaving the nest. We procured several of different sizes,
which we kept on the deck. Whenever a person approached them,
they raised their heads, stretched their necks, and opened their bills,
so as to expand the skin of the throat, which they made to vibrate,
while they uttered a sort of hissing mutter of a very strange character,
but resembling that of the young of the Brown Pelican. They crawled
sluggishly about, aiding themselves in their progress with their bills, and
at all times looked extremely clumsy. They took food very readily, ate
a prodigious quantity, certainly more than their own weight each day,
and appeared always ready to receive more. When thrown overboard,
they swam off under water, like the old birds, with considerable speed,
moving their unfledged wings all the while. Some would not rise for
twenty or thirty yards, but few went farther under water than that distance,
and they were soon fatigued. On one occasion, some half-grown
young birds threw themselves from their nest, or were pushed off by their
parents while in the agonies of death, they having been shot at. As they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' href='#Page_461'>461</a></span>
passed quickly downwards through the air, they moved their wings with
great rapidity, and the instant they reached the water they disappeared
beneath the surface.
</p>

<p>
This Cormorant swims at times with astonishing speed, keeping itself
deeply immersed. Now and then, should it apprehend danger, it
sinks so far as to shew only the head and neck, in the manner of the
Anhinga. When searching for food in clear shallow water, they frequently
swim with the rump rather elevated, and the head under, in
the manner of the Shoveller Duck on such occasions, as if they were
looking for prey on the bottom; but I never observed them act thus
when the depth of water exceeded a few yards. They secure their prey
by diving and pursuing it under water, with the wings partially extended
and employed as paddles, while the tail directs their course, and
checks or accelerates their speed. I have observed this in the Florida
Cormorant, as well as in the present species. I never saw one while flying
plunge after its prey; but I have repeatedly seen them drop from
a rock headlong into the sea when shot at for the purpose of observing
their actions.
</p>

<p>
Cormorants, Pelicans, Ducks, and other water birds of various kinds,
are, like land birds, at times infested with insects which lodge near the roots
of their feathers; and to clear themselves of this vermin, they beat up the
water about them by flapping their wings, their feathers being all the while
ruffled up, and rub or scratch themselves with their feet and claws, much
in the same manner as Turkeys and most land birds act, when scattering
up the dry warm earth or sand over them. The water birds after thus cleansing
themselves remove, if perchers, and able to fly, to the branches of trees,
spread out their wings and tail in the sun, and after a while dress their
plumage. Those which are not perchers, or whose wings are too wet,
swim to the shores, or to such banks or rocks as are above water, and
there perform the same process. The Florida Cormorant is especially
addicted to this practice, and dives and plumes itself several times in the
day. The Double-crested and the present species, which inhabit colder
regions, seem to be satisfied with less frequent trimming, and go through
the operation only once a-day, at the warmest period. I never observed
any of these birds in their natural free state perform these actions in rainy
or even cloudy weather, but have frequently seen Cormorants in a state
of captivity do so on small artificial ponds, such as those of the London
Zoological Gardens.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_462' href='#Page_462'>462</a></span>
</p>

<p>
When they have landed after cleansing themselves by washing, they
usually extend their wings, and flap them for a while, in the manner of
young birds of any kind when trying the strength of their wings before
leaving the nest. They are extremely regular in returning to the same
places to roost, at the approach of night, when hundreds appear to congregate
on their way there, as they pass over the different fishing grounds.
Those that have no broods, spend the night apart from the rest, standing
nearly erect in files on the most elevated shelves, to which they ascend in
the manner of some Hawks, when about to perch on any elevated spot. In
winter, however, I observed some near Boston roosting singly, and immediately
over their fishing places, which are usually the eddies under the
projecting points of rocky islands. They are shy and wary at all periods;
but when congregated in the day, it is almost impossible to approach
them while fishing, for they dive and return to the surface one after another,
so that one or more are constantly on the watch, and act as sentinels.
It is in general quite useless to pursue one that has been wounded.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is strong, swift, and remarkably sustained.
They usually fly in long strings, now and then forming angles, at a moderate
elevation in the air. When on the rocks, they stand erect on their
rump, with the neck gracefully curved, and resting between the shoulders.
You may see them in hundreds, when they look like a crowd of black
dominoes. If alarmed, they extend their neck to its full length, and move
their head sideways to observe your motions; and if you approach them,
they gradually raise and extend their wings, elevate the tail, incline the
body forwards, and fly off in silence.
</p>

<p>
All our Cormorants feed principally on fish of various kinds. When
they have seized one that is too large to be swallowed entire, they carry
it to the shore, or to the branch of a tree, and there thrash and tear it to
pieces. Some fishes which they have swallowed evidently incommode
them, and on such occasions I have sometimes seen them shake their heads
with great violence, and disgorge the fish, or pass it downwards into the
stomach. The young ones which we kept several weeks at Labrador,
performed both actions, but generally the first. All the species are expert
at tossing up a fish inconveniently caught, a foot or so above their
head, and receiving it in their extended gullet, in the same manner as the
Frigate Pelican, of which an account will be given in the present volume.
Some which I have observed in a domesticated state, were so expert
at receiving a fish thrown to them from the distance of several yards,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
by a sudden and precise movement of the neck and head, as seldom to
miss one in a dozen.
</p>

<p>
The courtship of this species is so similar to that of the Florida Cormorant,
that I consider it unnecessary to describe it, as I should merely repeat
what has been said with respect to that species. I have seen them act in
the same manner, both on the shelves on which the nests were placed, and
on the water. They begin to lay about the first of June, on the islands
near the Bay of Fundy, about a fortnight later in Labrador, and it is
my opinion that the younger birds spend their breeding season in the
former places.
</p>

<p>
The Common Cormorant walks in a waddling and awkward manner,
but at a good pace, and leaps from one stone to another, assisting itself
with its wings, and occasionally with the tail, which acts as a kind of
spring. I am unable to say at what age this species attains the full dress
of the love season, but it cannot be in less than three years, as some which
I have known to have been kept in a state of constant captivity, did not
shew the white patch on the thigh, nor the slender white feathers around
the head and part of the neck, until the middle of May, in the fifth year.
That the younger birds of this and other Cormorants, breed before they
have acquired the full beauty of their plumage, is a fact which I have
had many opportunities of ascertaining. The Common Cormorant is
found breeding, both near the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, and along
the coast of Labrador, in flocks of fifty or more pairs, of which not an
individual shews any white unless on the sides of the head, and along the
throat, but much duller on these parts than even in the female represented
in the plate, which was yet what may be termed an immature bird.
No differences appear in the garb of the sexes, in their different states of
plumage, and perfect specimens of both are equally beautiful in the breeding
season, being then similar to the male of which I have endeavoured
to present a good portrait. I have observed a greater difference in size
between individuals of this species, than those of any other.
</p>

<p>
The white markings observed on the old birds of this species, during
the period of courtship, incubation, and rearing of the young until they
are able to fly, and which extends to two months and a half, begin to
disappear from the moment incubation has fairly begun, and at the time
when the young leave the nest scarcely any remain, unless on the sides
of the head. In autumn and winter the feathers of the head are similar
to those of the neck, and the plumage in general has lost much of its vernal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_464' href='#Page_464'>464</a></span>
and æstival beauty. The entire crest also falls off in autumn. The
white markings and the crest are renewed in the wild state about the end
of February; but in birds kept in domestication rarely before May.
The young do not exhibit the crest until the second spring, at which
period, being yet destitute of white markings on the head and thighs,
they might readily be mistaken for a different species, by a person unacquainted
with their habits.
</p>

<p>
The singular fact that the young of the three species of Cormorant
described in this volume, have <i>open nostrils</i> until they are nearly half-grown,
may surprise you as much as it surprised me. Having observed
it in many individuals, I preserved one in spirits, and of it you will find
a description beneath.
</p>

<p>
The Common Cormorant is rarely seen farther south than the extreme
limits of Maryland; but from Chesapeake Bay eastward, it becomes
more plentiful; and in severe winters, I have seen it exposed for sale in
the New York market. They are abundant in winter around the islands
of the Bay of Boston, and on the coasts of Massachusetts and Maine,
where most of them remain during autumn, winter, and the early part of
spring, as well as on the Bay of Fundy and along the shores of Nova
Scotia. I am unable to say how far north they go beyond Labrador, to
breed, or what may be the limits of their range on the St Lawrence in
autumn. I have never seen one on a tree, or on fresh water. The flesh
of this species is dark, tough, and fishy, its eggs also do not furnish
agreeable food, and it is seldom that either are eaten, even by epicures.

<p>
The Female when old is similar to the male. In the state here represented,
the plumage in general is similar, but the white feathers of
the head and thighs are wanting. The bill, eyes and feet are coloured as
in the male, as are the bare parts about the base of the bill, only the
part under the eye which is bright red in the male, is bright yellow in
the female.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Young Birds unfledged. Plate CCLXVI. Fig. 3, 4.
</p>

<p>
The inside of the mouth and the gular sac flesh-coloured; the bill
dusky, at the base flesh-coloured; the eyes bluish grey. The general colour
of their skin is dull livid; the feet purplish-dusky, the webs yellowish-brown.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The following is a description of the smaller individual represented in
the plate, and which was about two weeks old. The length is twelve
inches and a half; the colour dull livid, the abdomen and breast lighter,
the forehead, gular sac, and bases of the mandibles, flesh-colour tinged
with yellow, as is the mouth. The head and upper part of the neck are
bare, as well as the lower surface of the wings. Over the rest of the body
are small down tufts rising in regular series, excepting along an impressed
line extending from the anterior part of the thorax to the anus. The
apertures of the ears are round, extremely small, being only half a twelfth
in diameter; the eyes very small, the iris grey. The aperture of the
posterior nares is linear-lanceolate, smooth on the edges, half an inch long.
A probe introduced into it passes readily out by the nostril, which is basal,
linear, small, two-twelfths long, placed at the commencement of the long
groove which separates the sides from the ridge of the mandible, and covered
above by the skin, so as to be not readily observed, although it is
easily dilatable. Each internal nostril is oblique, much wider below, and
has on its inner side a transverse soft ridge, which divides it into two cavities,
the posterior deep and funnel-shaped, passing backwards and upwards,
the anterior becoming narrower towards the external aperture.
The tongue is extremely small, four-twelfths long, elliptical, with a central
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_467' href='#Page_467'>467</a></span>
ridge. The œsophagus is extremely dilatable, and as far as the middle
of the neck is of larger diameter than below, but it again dilates as it
enters the stomach. Its length is five inches and a half. The inner coat
is smooth in its dilated part, but in the rest is raised into numerous longitudinal
ridges or folds, which at the lower part are undulated. The
stomach is oblong, four and a half inches long, quite membranous, and
without apparent central tendons. The gastric glands are disposed so as
to occupy two spaces, the one three and a half inches by two, the other a
little smaller. The inner coat is soft and without wrinkles. The intestine
is five feet two inches long, at its upper part three-twelfths in
diameter, gradually diminishing to one-twelfth. At the distance of two
inches from the anus are two cœca, three-twelfths long, one-twelfth in
diameter, and rounded. The contents of the stomach were fragments of
fish, with numerous bones, and a pebble about half an inch in diameter.
The heart triangular, much flattened. The liver of two very unequal
lobes, the right one two inches and a half long, the other one and a half.
The specimen, which I had preserved in spirits, was examined in my presence
by my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>. Whether the fact of the anterior
aperture of the organ of smell being open in the young Cormorant has been
observed by any other person than myself, I know not; but it would seem
that the general opinion is, that Cormorants have no external nares in any
stage, and although some state that in the adult they exist, and are extremely
small, others allege that there are none at all.
</p>

<p>
A young female, shot in the end of October, on being carefully examined,
was found to present the following characters.
</p>

<p>
The length to the end of the tail was 36 inches, to the end of the
wings
<span class="mixfract">29&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>, to the end of the outer toe
<span class="mixfract">34&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>; the extent of the wings 55;
the weight 5 lb.

</p>

<p>
Bill along the ridge and unguis black, the sides brownish-grey; the
lower mandible brownish-grey, dusky on the sides at the middle, the bare
skin at the base yellow, as is the gular sac. Upper part of the head and
hind neck brownish-black; the back greenish-black, its fore part, the scapulars
and the wing-coverts brownish-grey, the feathers edged with greenish-black,
and an outer margin of brownish-white, most conspicuous on
the secondary coverts; the quills brownish-black, the secondaries tinged
with grey on the outer edge; the tail greyish-black, the shafts greyish-blue.
Upper part of the throat brownish-white; the rest of the neck
greyish-white, mixed with brown; the breast and abdomen white, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' href='#Page_468'>468</a></span>
sides greenish-black; the lower surface of the wings dusky; the lower
tail-coverts greyish-brown, the feathers before them brownish-black. The
feet greyish-black; the inner edge of the middle claws very slightly pectinated.
The foot, when stretched to its full extent, measures, from the
tip of the first to that of the fourth claw,
<span class="mixfract">5&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">10</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> inches.
</p>

<p>
The tongue is oblong, carinate above, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> long, <span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> broad. The palatal
slit or aperture of the posterior nares is linear,
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> long, with a soft
flap on each side. The mouth is
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> wide; the bill
<span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> along the back,
4 along the edge of lower mandible. The aperture of the ear is circular,
only half a line in diameter.
</p>

<p>
On blowing into the posterior nares no air passes. The internal cavities
are separated by a longitudinal membranous dissepiment; each cavity
is transversely divided by a membranous partition, but neither of the
chambers thus formed has any external communication by the mandible.
The lachrymal duct, which is wide, passes obliquely forward and downward
into the anterior cavity. On gradually slicing the horny covering
of the mandible over the place where the nostril ought to be, its position
is found clearly defined, there being a slight discontinuity of the bone at
that part; but on cutting farther all traces disappear, the original aperture
being closed by ossification.
</p>

<p>
The aperture of the glottis has thick prominent rounded edges, which
unite behind and terminate in three knobs, and there is a small transverse
flap on each side behind.
</p>

<p>
The heart is triangular, depressed, obtuse,
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, its greatest
breadth
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span>. The liver has two very unequal lobes, the right 5 inches,
the left 3 inches long; the former
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> broad, the latter
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>. The gall-bladder
is
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> long, <span class="fract"><span class="fup"><span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span></span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> in diameter, rounded, but not much enlarged at the extremity.
</p>

<p>
The œsophagus is
<span class="mixfract">22&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long; at its upper part when dilated
upwards of two inches wide, extremely thin, its circular fibres distinct.
It is contracted in the whole length of the thorax, where its smallest diameter
is <span class="fract"><span class="fup">8</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, the largest <span class="fract"><span class="fup">10</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>; but this part, which in the ordinary state has
its inner coat folded into numerous longitudinal wrinkles, is capable of
being dilated so as to present a diameter of more than 3 inches, when the
internal rugæ disappears. The proventriculus seems at first to form part
of the stomach; its walls are extremely thick and studded with glandules,
disposed in two circular patches, which are separated by a space of about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> of an inch. The stomach properly so called is very small; its muscular
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_469' href='#Page_469'>469</a></span>
coat thin, but with two distinct tendons. It is of an oblong form,
compressed, and at its upper parts has a rounded lobe, from which the intestine
comes off. The inner coat is thick, soft, and rugous. The pylorus
has a circular marginal rim. The intestine, which is 8 feet long, is at its upper
part <span class="fract"><span class="fup"><span class="mixfract">3&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span></span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> in diameter, towards the cœca <span class="fract"><span class="fup"><span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">4</span></span></span></span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>. The rectum is 7 inches long,
its diameter for
<span class="mixfract">4&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches is <span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>; the cloaca globular,
<span class="mixfract">2&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span></span> in diameter; the
cœca <span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span> long. The cystic duct enters one inch below the hepatic; between
them enters one of the pancreatic ducts, the other 2 inches farther up.
The distance from the pylorus to the hepatic duct is
<span class="mixfract">16&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches.
</p>

<p>
The lungs extend to the kidneys. The ovules exceedingly small and
numerous. In the proventriculus and lower part of the œsophagus were
many small ascarides. The contents of the stomach were a few bones
of fishes.
</p>

<p>
Although I have not actually observed that Cormorants have the
power of disgorging such substances as they are unable to digest, I should
not be surprised to find this to be the case, when their habits are investigated
in a state of domestication.

THE ARCTIC JAGER.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Lestris parasiticus</i>, Boie.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
During winter this indefatigable teaser of the smaller Gulls often
ranges along our southern coasts as far as the Mexican Gulf, where I
have seen it, as well as opposite the shores of the Floridas; but I never
met with a single individual in summer, even in the most northern parts,
although I had expected to find it breeding on the coasts of Labrador
and Newfoundland. Few birds surpass it in power or length of flight.
It generally passes through the air at a height of fifty or sixty yards,
flying in an easy manner, ranging over the broad bays, on which Gulls
of various kinds are engaged in procuring their food. No sooner has it
observed that one of them has secured a fish, than it immediately flies toward
it and gives chase. It is almost impossible for the Gull to escape,
for the warrior with repeated jerkings of his firm pinions sweeps towards
it, with the rapidity of a Peregrine Falcon pouncing on a Duck. Each
cut and turn of the Gull only irritates him the more and whets his keen
appetite, until by two or three sudden dashes, he forces it to disgorge the
food it had so lately swallowed. This done, the poor Gull may go in
search of more; the Lestris is now for a while contented, and alights on
the water to feed at leisure. But soon, perceiving a distant flock of
Gulls, he rises on wing and speeds towards them. Renewing his attacks,
he now obtains an abundant supply, and at length, when quite
gorged, searches for a place on which to alight, unseen by any other of his
tribe more powerful than himself. When on wing, its beautiful long
tail-feathers seem at times to afford this bird great assistance in executing
short sudden turns, which have often brought to my mind the motions
of a greyhound while pursuing a hare. By sudden lashings of its
tail, it can instantly turn, or arrest its flight. When it is on the water,
it keeps that part upright, but when on a rock or a floating piece of timber,
it allows it to fall in a graceful manner.
</p>

<p>
Although usually seen single, or at most in pairs, during the winter,
I observed this species in April, on my voyage to the Florida Keys, in
flocks of from ten to fifteen, congregated as if for the purpose of returning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_471' href='#Page_471'>471</a></span>
to the northern regions, where it is said to breed in groups. Mr
<span class="smcap">Selby</span>, in treating of this bird, says “It breeds upon several of the
Orkney and Shetland Isles, and is gregarious during that period; and
the situations selected for nidification are the unfrequented heaths at some
distance from the shores. The nest is composed of dry grass and mosses,
and its two eggs are of a dark oil-green, with irregular blotches of liver-brown.
At this season the bird is very courageous, and, like the Common
Skua, attacks every intruder upon the limits of its territory, by
pouncing and striking at the head with its bill and wings. It also occasionally
endeavours to divert attention by feigning accidental lameness.”
Having received eggs of this bird from individuals who had collected
them, I may add that they are broadly rounded at the larger end, rather
pointed at the smaller, have a smooth shell, and average two inches four-twelfths
in length, by one inch and four and a half eighths in breadth.
</p>

<p>
M. <span class="smcap">Temminck</span>, in his Manuel d’Ornithologie, describes the young
when about to leave the nest as follows: “Top of the head of a deep
grey; sides and upper part of the neck of a light grey, sprinkled with
longitudinal brown spots; a black spot before the eyes; lower part of
the neck, back, scapulars, small and large wing-coverts, umber-brown,
each feather bordered with yellowish-brown, and often with reddish;
lower parts irregularly variegated with deep brown and yellowish-brown
on a whitish ground; tail-coverts and abdomen transversely barred;
quills of the wings and tail blackish, white at their base and on the inner
barbs, all terminated with white; the two outer shafts white; tail only
rounded; base of the bill yellowish-green, black towards the point; tarsi
bluish-grey; base of the toes and membranes white, the rest black, hind
claw often white.”
</p>

<p>
In middle age, he says, “all the upper parts are greyish-brown without
spots; lower parts of a somewhat lighter tint, and also unspotted;
inner base of the quills and only the upper parts of the tail-feathers pure
white, the rest blackish-brown; the two elongated tail-feathers gradually
diminish in breadth towards the extremity, which ends in a very attenuated
point; bill and feet as in the old individuals.”
</p>

<p>
Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span> has informed me by letter, that this species
was seen in great numbers during his late voyage towards the Arctic
circle; that the Pomarine Lestris was less abundant, and <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>’s
very rare.

THE AMERICAN WOODCOCK.

<p>
There is a kind of innocent simplicity in our Woodcock, which has
often excited in me a deep feeling of anxiety, when I witnessed the rude
and unmerciful attempts of mischievous boys, on meeting a mother bird
in vain attempting to preserve her dear brood from their savage grasp.
She scarcely limps, nor does she often flutter along the ground, on such
occasions; but with half extended wings, inclining her head to one side,
and uttering a soft murmur, she moves to and fro, urging her young to
hasten towards some secure spot beyond the reach of their enemies. Regardless
of her own danger, she would to all appearance gladly suffer
herself to be seized, could she be assured that by such a sacrifice she
might ensure the safety of her brood. On an occasion of this kind, I saw
a female Woodcock lay herself down on the middle of a road, as if she
were dead, while her little ones, five in number, were endeavouring on
feeble legs to escape from a pack of naughty boys, who had already
caught one of them, and were kicking it over the dust in barbarous sport.
The mother might have shared the same fate, had I not happened to issue
from the thicket, and interpose in her behalf.
</p>

<p>
The American Woodcock, although allied to our Common Snipe,
<i>Scolopax Wilsonii</i>, differs essentially from it in its habits, even more than
in form. The former is a much gentler bird than the latter, and although
both see at night, the Woodcock is more nocturnal than the Snipe. The
latter often, without provocation or apparent object, migrates or takes
long and elevated flights during the day; but the Woodcock rarely takes
flight at this time, unless forced to do so to elude its enemies, and even
then removes only to a short distance. When rambling unconcernedly,
it rarely passes high above the tree tops, or is seen before the dusk or
after the morning twilight, when it flies rather low, generally through
the woods; and its travels are altogether performed under night. The
largeness of its eyes, as compared with those of the Snipe, might of itself
enable one to form such a conclusion; but there is moreover a difference
in the habits of the Woodcock and Snipe, which I have been surprised at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_475' href='#Page_475'>475</a></span>
not finding mentioned by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who certainly was an acute observer.
It is that the Woodcock, although a prober of the mire, frequently alights
in the interior of extensive forests, where little moisture can be seen, for
the purpose of turning up the dead leaves with its bill, in search of
food beneath them, in the manner of the Passenger Pigeon, various
Grakles, and other birds. This the Snipe, I believe, has never been observed
to do. Indeed, although the latter at times alights on the borders
of pools or streams overhung by trees, it never flies through the woods.
</p>

<p>
The American Woodcock, which in New Brunswick is named the
Bog-sucker, is found dispersed in abundance during winter, over the
southern parts of the Union, and now and then, in warm and sequestered
places, even in the Middle Districts. Its stay in any portion of the country
at this period, seems to depend altogether on the state of the weather.
In the Carolinas, or even in Lower Louisiana, after a night of severe frost,
I have found their number greatly diminished in places where they had
been observed to be plentiful the day before. The limits of its northern
migrations at the commencement of the breeding season, are yet unascertained.
When in Newfoundland I was assured that it breeds there; but
I met with none either in that country or in Labrador, although it is not
rare in the British Provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia during
summer. From the beginning of March until late in October, this bird
may be found in every district of the Union that affords places suited to
its habits; and its numbers, I am persuaded, are much greater than is
usually supposed. As it feeds by night, it is rarely met with by day, unless
by a sportsman or gunner, who may be engaged in pursuing it for
pleasure or profit. It is, however, killed in almost incredible numbers,
from the beginning of July until late in winter, in different parts of the
Union, and our markets are amply supplied with it during its season.
You may at times see gunners returning from their sports with a load of
Woodcocks, composed of several dozens; nay, adepts in the sport have
been known to kill upwards of a hundred in the course of a day, being
assisted by relays of dogs, and perhaps a change of guns. In Lower
Louisiana, they are slaughtered under night by men carrying lighted
torches, which so surprise the poor things that they stand gazing on the
light until knocked dead with a pole or cane. This, however, takes place
only on the sugar and cotton plantations.
</p>

<p>
At the time when the Woodcocks are travelling from the south towards
all parts of the United States, on their way to their breeding places,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' href='#Page_476'>476</a></span>
these birds, although they migrate singly, follow each other with such
rapidity, that they might be said to arrive in flocks, the one coming directly
in the wake of the other. This is particularly observable by a
person standing on the eastern banks of the Mississippi or the Ohio, in
the evening dusk, from the middle of March to that of April, when almost
every instant there whizzes past him a Woodcock, with a velocity
equalling that of our swiftest birds. See them flying across and low over
the broad stream; the sound produced by the action of their wings
reaches your ear as they approach, and gradually dies away after they
have passed and again entered the woods. While travelling with my
family, in the month of October, through New Brunswick and the
northern part of the State of Maine, I saw the Woodcocks returning
southward in equal numbers late in the evenings, and in the same continuous
manner, within a few yards or even feet of the ground, on the
roads or through the woods.
</p>

<p>
This species finds itself accommodated in the warmer parts of the
United States, as well as in high northern latitudes, during the breeding
season: it is well known to reproduce in the neighbourhood of Savannah
in Georgia, and near Charleston in South Carolina. My friend <span class="smcap">John
Bachman</span> has known thirty young ones, not yet fully fledged, to have
been killed in the vicinity of the latter place in one day. I have never
found its nest in Louisiana, but I have frequently fallen in with it in the
States from Mississippi to Kentucky, in which latter country it breeds
abundantly. In the Middle Districts, the Woodcock begins to pair in
the end of March; in the southern a month earlier. At this season,
its curious spiral gyrations, while ascending or descending along a space
of fifty or more yards of height, in the manner described in the article
of the Snipe, when it utters a note different from the cry of that bird,
and somewhat resembling the word <i>kwauk</i>, are performed every evening
and morning for nearly a fortnight. While on the ground, at
this season as well as in autumn, the male not unfrequently repeats this
sound, as if he were calling to others in his neighbourhood, and on hearing
it answered, immediately flies to meet the other bird, which in the
same manner advances toward him. On observing the Woodcock while
in the act of emitting these notes, you would imagine he exerted himself
to the utmost to produce them, its head and bill being inclined towards
the ground, and a strong forward movement of the body taking place at
the moment the kwauk reaches your ear. This over, the bird jerks its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
half-spread tail, then erects itself, and stands as if listening for a few moments,
when, if the cry is not answered, it repeats it. I feel pretty confident
that, in spring, the female, attracted by these sounds, flies to the
male; for on several occasions I observed the bird that had uttered the
call immediately caress the one that had just arrived, and which I knew
from its greater size to be a female. I am not, however, quite certain
that this is always the case, for on other occasions I have seen a male fly
off and alight near another, when they would immediately begin to fight,
tugging at and pushing each other with their bills, in the most curious
manner imaginable.
</p>

<p>
The nest, which is formed of dried leaves and grass, without much
apparent care, is usually placed in some secluded part of the woods, at
the foot of some bush, or by the side of a fallen trunk. In one instance,
near Camden, in New Jersey, I found one in a small swamp, on the upper
part of a log, the lower portion of which was covered with water to the
height of several inches. The eggs, which are laid from February to the
first of June, according to the latitude of the place selected, are usually
four, although I have not very unfrequently found five in a nest. They
average one inch and five and a half-eighths in length, by one inch and
an eighth in breadth, are smooth, of a dull yellowish clay colour, varying
in depth, and irregularly but pretty thickly marked with patches of dark
brown, and others of a purple tint.
</p>

<p>
The young run about as soon as they emerge from the shell. To my
astonishment, I once met with three of them on the border of a sand-bar
on the Ohio, without their parent, and to all appearance not more than
half a day old. I concealed myself near them for about half an hour,
during which time the little things continued to totter about the edge of the
water, as if their mother had gone that way. During the time I remained
I did not see the old bird, and what became of them I know not. The
young birds are at first covered with down of a dull yellowish-brown colour,
then become streaked with deeper umber tints, and gradually acquire
the colours of the old. At the age of from three to four weeks, although
not fully fledged, they are able to fly and escape from their enemies, and
when they are six weeks old, it requires nearly as much skill to shoot
them on wing as if they were much older. At this age they are called
<i>stupid</i> by most people; and, in fact, being themselves innocent, and not
yet having had much experience, they are not sufficiently aware of the
danger that may threaten them, when a two-legged monster, armed with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_478' href='#Page_478'>478</a></span>
a gun, makes his appearance. But, Reader, observe an old cock on such
occasions: there he lies, snugly squatted beneath the broad leaves of that
“sconk cabbage” or dock. I see its large dark eye meeting my glance;
the bird shrinks as it were within its usual size, and, in a crouching attitude,
it shifts with short steps to the other side. The nose of the faithful
pointer marks the spot, but unless you are well acquainted with the ways
of Woodcocks, it has every chance of escaping from you both, for at this
moment it runs off through the grass, reaches a clump of bushes, crosses it,
and, taking to wing from a place toward which neither you nor your dog
have been looking, you become flustered, take a bad aim, and lose your shot.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of persons besides you and myself are fond of Woodcock
shooting. It is a healthful but at times laborious sport. You well know
the places where the birds are to be found under any circumstances; you
are aware that, if the weather has been for some time dry, you must resort
to the damp meadows that border the Schuylkil, or some similar places;
that should it be sultry, the covered swamps are the spots which you ought
to visit; but if it be still lowering after continued rain, the southern sides
of gentle hills will be found preferable; that if the ground is covered
with snow, the oozy places visited by the Snipe are as much resorted to
by the Woodcock; that after long frost, the covered thickets along some
meandering stream are the places of their retreat; and you are aware
that, at all times, it is better for you to have a dog of any kind than
to go without a dog at all. Well, you have started a bird, which with
easy flaps flies before you in such a way that if you miss it, your companion
certainly will not. Should he, however, prove as unsuccessful
as yourself, you may put up the bird once, twice, or thrice in succession,
for it will either alight in some clump of low trees close by, or plunge
into a boggy part of the marsh. As you advance towards him, you
may chance to put up half a score more, and <i>stupid</i> though you should
be, you must be a bad shot indeed if you do not bring some one of
them to the ground. Aye, you have done it, and are improving at the
sport, and you may be assured that the killing of Woodcocks requires
more practice than almost any other kind of shooting. The young sportsman
shoots too quick, or does not shoot at all, in both which cases the
game is much better pleased than you are yourself. But when once you
have acquired the necessary coolness and dexterity, you may fire, charge
and fire again from morning till night, and go on thus during the whole
of the Woodcock season.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_479' href='#Page_479'>479</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Now and then, the American Woodcock, after being pursued for a
considerable time, throws itself into the centre of large miry places, where
it is very difficult for either man or dog to approach it; and indeed if
you succeed, it will not rise unless you almost tread upon it. In such
cases I have seen dogs point at them, when they were only a few inches
distant, and after several minutes seize upon them. When in clear woods,
such as pine barrens, the Woodcock on being put up flies at times to a
considerable distance, and then performs a circuit and alights not far
from you. It is extremely attached to particular spots, to which it returns
after being disturbed.
</p>

<p>
Its flight is performed by constant rather rapid beats of the wings,
and while migrating it passes along with great speed. I am inclined to
think its flight is greatly protracted, on account of the early periods at
which it reaches Maine and New Brunswick:—I may be wrong, but I
am of opinion that at such times it flies faster than our little Partridge.
In proceeding, it inclines irregularly to the right and left at the end of
every few yards; but when it has been put up after having settled for a
while, it rises as if not caring about you, and at a slow pace goes a few
yards and alights again, runs a few steps and squats to await your departure.
It is less addicted to wading through the water than the Snipe,
and never searches for food in salt marshes or brackish places. Rivulets
that run through thickets, and of which the margins are muddy or composed
of oozy ground, are mostly preferred by it; but, as I have already
said, its place of abode depends upon the state of the weather and the degree
of temperature.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Woodcock consists principally of large earth-worms,
of which it swallows as many in the course of a night as would equal its
own weight; but its power of digestion is as great as that of the Herons,
and it is not very often that on opening one you find entire worms in its
stomach. It obtains its food by perforating the damp earth or mire, and
also by turning the dead leaves in the woods, and picking up the worms
that lie beneath them. In captivity, Woodcocks very soon accustom
themselves to feed on moistened corn meal, bits of cheese, and vermicelli
soaked in water. I have seen some that became so gentle as to allow their
owner to caress them with the hand. On watching several individuals
probing mud in which a number of earthworms had been introduced, in
a tub placed in a room partially darkened, I observed the birds plunge
their bills up to the nostrils, but never deeper; and from the motion of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>
the parts at the base of the mandibles, I concluded that the bird has the
power of working their extremities so as to produce a kind of vacuum,
which enables it to seize the worm at one end, and suck it into its throat
before it withdraws its bill, as do Curlews and Godwits. The quickness
of their sight on such occasions was put to the test by uncovering a cat
placed in the corner of the room, at the same height above the floor as
the surface of the mud which filled the tub, when instantly the Woodcock
would draw out its bill, jerk up its tail, spread it out, leap upon the floor,
and run off to the opposite corner. At other times, when the cat was
placed beneath the level of the bird, by the whole height of the tub, which
was rather more than a foot, the same result took place; and I concluded
that the elevated position of this bird’s eye was probably intended to
enable it to see its enemies at a considerable distance, and watch their
approach, while it is in the act of probing, and not to protect that organ
from the mire, as the Woodcock is always extremely clean, and never
shews any earth adhering to the feathers about its mouth.
</p>

<p>
How comfortable it is when fatigued and covered with mud, your
clothes drenched with wet, and your stomach aching for food, you arrive
at home with a bag of Woodcocks, and meet the kind smiles of those you
love best, and which are a thousand times more delightful to your eye,
than the savoury flesh of the most delicate of birds can be to your palate.
When you have shifted your clothes, and know that on the little round
table already spread, you will ere long see a dish of game, which will
both remove your hunger and augment the pleasure of your family; when
you are seated in the midst of the little group, and now see some one
neatly arrayed introduce the mess, so white, so tender, and so beautifully
surrounded by savoury juice; when a jug of sparkling Newark cider
stands nigh; and you, without knife or fork, quarter a Woodcock, ah
Reader!—But alas! I am not in the Jerseys just now, in the company of
my generous friend <span class="smcap">Edward Harris</span>; nor am I under the hospitable
roof of my equally esteemed friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>. No, Reader, I am
in Edinburgh, wielding my iron pen, without any expectation of Woodcocks
for my dinner, either to-day or to-morrow, or indeed for some
months to come.

THE GREENSHANK.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXIX. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
While on Sand Key, which is about six miles distant from Cape
Sable of the Floridas, in lat. 24° 57´ north, and 81° 45´ long, west of
Greenwich, I shot three birds of this species on the 28th of May 1832.
I had at first supposed them to be Tell-tale Godwits, as they walked
on the bars and into the shallows much in the same manner, and, on
obtaining them, imagined they were new; but on shewing them to my
assistant Mr <span class="smcap">Ward</span>, who was acquainted with the Greenshank of Europe,
he pronounced them to be of that species, and I have since ascertained the
fact by a comparison of specimens. They were all male birds, and I
observed no material difference in their plumage. We did not find any
afterwards; but it is probable that we had seen some previously, although
we did not endeavour to procure them, having supposed them to be Tell-tales.
Almost all the birds seen in the Floridas at this date had young
or eggs; and this circumstance increased my surprise at finding all the
three individuals to be males. They had been shot merely because they
offered a tempting opportunity, being all close together, and it is not often
that one can kill three Tell-tales at once. As I am not acquainted with
the habits of this species, I have applied to my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span>,
who has kindly furnished me with the following notice of them as observed
in the Hebrides.
</p>

<p>
“The Greenshank is seen in the Outer Hebrides early in spring, and
generally departs in October, although I have observed individuals there in
November. Previous to the commencement of the breeding-season, and
after the young are fledged, it resorts to the shores of the sea, frequenting
pools of brackish-water at the head of the sand-fords, and the shallow
margins of bays and creeks. Its habits are very similar to those of the
Redshank, with which it associates in autumn. It is extremely shy and
vigilant, insomuch that one can very seldom shoot it, unless after it has
deposited its eggs. Many individuals remain during the summer, when
they are to be found by the lakes in the interior, of which the number in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_484' href='#Page_484'>484</a></span>
Uist, Harris, and Lewis is astonishing. At that season it is very easily
discovered, for when you are perhaps more than a quarter of a mile distant,
it rises into the air with clamorous cries, alarming all the birds in
its neighbourhood, flies round the place of its nest, now wheeling off to a
distance, again advancing towards you, and at intervals alighting by the
edge of the lake, when it continues its cries, vibrating its body all the
while. I once found a nest of this bird in the island of Harris. It was
at a considerable distance from the water, and consisted of a few fragments
of heath and some blades of grass, placed in a shallow cavity scraped in
the turf, in an exposed place. The nest, in fact, resembled that of the
Golden Plover, the Curlew, or the Lapwing. The eggs, placed with
their narrow ends together, were four in number, pyriform, larger than
those of the Lapwing, and smaller than those of the Golden Plover,
equally pointed with the latter, but proportionally broader and more
rounded at the larger end than either. The dimensions of one of them,
still remaining with me, are two inches exactly, by one inch and three-eighths;
the ground colour is a very pale yellowish-green, sprinkled all
over with irregular spots of dark brown, intermixed with blotches of light
purplish-grey, the spots, and especially the blotches, more numerous on
the larger end. Although in summer these birds may be seen in many
parts of the islands, they are yet very rare, a pair being to be met with
only at an interval of several miles. In other parts of Scotland they are
seen chiefly in autumn, but are of rare occurrence.”
</p>

<p>
It is curious how nearly by this account the habits of the Greenshank
correspond with those of the Tell-tale Godwit, <i>Totanus melanoleucos</i>.

WILSON’S PETREL.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXX. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
A long voyage would always be to me a continued source of suffering,
were I restrained from gazing on the vast expanse of the waters, and
on the ever-pleasing inhabitants of the air that now and then appear in the
ship’s wake. The slightest motion of the vessel effectually prevents me
from enjoying the mirth of my fellow passengers, or sympathizing with them
in their sickness. When the first glimpse of day appears, I make my
way on deck, where I stand not unlike a newly hatched bird, tottering
on feeble legs. Let the wind blow high or not, I care little which, provided
it waft me toward the shores of America. If the sky be clear, the
first sight of the sun excites emotions of gratitude towards the Being
by whose power it was formed, and sent forth to shed its benign influence
on surrounding worlds. Silent adoration occupies my soul, and I conclude
with ardent wishes for the happiness of friends left far behind, and
those toward whom I am proceeding. But now, ever flapping its winglets,
I have marked the little bird, dusky all over save a single spot, the
whiteness of which contrasts with the dark hue of the waters and the
deep tone of the clear sky. Full of life and joy it moves to and fro, advances
toward the ship, then shoots far away, gambols over the swelling
waves, dives into their hollows, and twitters with delight as it perceives
an object that will alleviate its hunger. Never fatigued, the tiny Petrels
seldom alight, although at times their frail legs and feet seem to
touch the crest of the foaming wave. I love to give every creature all
the pleasure I can confer upon it, and towards the little things I cast
over the stern such objects as I know they will most prize. Social creatures!
would that all were as innocent as you! There are no bickerings,
no jealousies among you; the first that comes is first served; it is all the
result of chance; and thus you pass your lives. But the clouds gather,
the gale approaches, and our gallant bark is trimmed. Darkness spreads
over the heavens, and the deep waters send back a blacker gloom, broken
at intervals by the glimmer of the spray. You meet the blast, and your
little wings bear you up against it for a while; but you cannot encounter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_487' href='#Page_487'>487</a></span>
the full force of the tempest; and now you have all come close beneath
me, where you glide over the curling eddies caused by the motion of the
rudder. You shall have all possible attention paid you, and I will crawl
to the camboose, in search of food to support your tiny frames in this
hour of need. But at length, night closes around, and I bid you farewell.
</p>

<p>
The gale is over; the clear blue of the sky looks clearer than ever,
the sun’s rays are brighter, on the quiet waters the ship seems to settle in
repose, and her wings, though widely spread, no longer swell with the
breeze. At a distance around us the dusky wanderers are enjoying the
bright morning; the rudder-fish, yesterday so lively, has ended its career,
so violently was it beaten by the waves against the vessel; and now the
Petrels gather around it, as it floats on the surface. Various other matters
they find; here a small crab, there the fragments of a sea-plant. Low
over the deep they range, and now with little steps run on the waters.
Few are their notes, but great their pleasure, at this moment. It is needless
for me to feed them now, and therefore I will return to my task.
</p>

<p>
It would be extremely difficult for any individual to determine the
extent of the movements of the three species of Petrel seen on the waters
of the Atlantic. My opinion is that until their breeding places are repeatedly
visited by naturalists, little can be known respecting the range
of their flight. I have crossed the ocean many times, and have always
paid more or less attention to these birds; yet I am as ignorant of their
migrations as my predecessors. I have rarely seen Wilson’s Petrel farther
to the eastward than the Azores, and beyond these islands it generally
abandoned the vessel. Along the American coast, I have not met with it
to the northward beyond the 51st degree of latitude; while to the southward
I have rarely observed many on the Gulf of Mexico; nor do I believe
that any breed on the shores of the Floridas, or on the Bahama Islands,
as alleged by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who, it would appear, stated so from report.
Petrels are rarely destroyed by men, quadrupeds, or rapacious birds, when
breeding; to the former they are of no value as an article of food, and
by the latter they are seldom sought after; consequently they are more
likely to return to their breeding places than most other birds, many of
which are frequently induced to abandon them on account of the persecutions
to which they are subjected. I have found the Forked-tailed
Petrel breeding on our coast, in the fissures of rocks above the reach of the
spray, and <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s digging for itself burrows in the sand or loose earth,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_488' href='#Page_488'>488</a></span>
on low islands. The <i>Thalassidroma pelagica</i> I have never found breeding
on any part of our coast; but it is well known that it resorts to holes
on certain of the Shetland Islands, among the blocks and stones of which
the beaches are formed; though it appears that in some spots, where the
fisherman are in the habit of destroying them, many resort to the elevated
fissures of the rocks, where also a few of the Forked-tailed species occasionally
breed. The latter then, though more abundant in America, belongs
to Europe also. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> was not aware that the species now
named after him was any thing else than “the Stormy Petrel, <i>Procellaria
pelagica</i> of <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>;” and he remarks that it “is found over the whole
Atlantic ocean, from Europe to North America, at all distances from
land, and in all weathers.”
</p>

<p>
To my learned friend the <span class="smcap">Prince of Musignano</span>, the scientific world
is indebted for a Memoir on Petrels, in which he has clearly shewn the
specific differences of the three species mentioned above, of which he has
also given figures, as well as those of the bills and feet nearly of the natural
size. But the artist who drew these birds for him, or the engraver,
committed an error in representing the present bird as the largest of the
three.
</p>

<p>
Wilson’s Petrel breeds on some small islands situated off the southern
extremity of Nova Scotia, and called “Mud Islands,” but which are
formed of sand and light earth, scantily covered with grass. Thither the
birds resort in great numbers, about the beginning of June, and form burrows
of the depth of two or two and a half feet, in the bottom of which
is laid a single white egg, a few bits of dry grass, scarcely deserving the
name of a nest, having been placed for its reception. The egg measures
an inch and a half in length, by seven-eighths of an inch in breadth, is
almost equally rounded at both ends, and has a pure white colour. These
Petrels copulate on the water, in the same manner as the Hyperborean
Phalarope. By the beginning of August the young follow their parents
to sea, and are then scarcely distinguishable from them. During incubation,
they remain in the burrows, or at their entrance, rarely going
to seek for food before the dusk.
</p>

<p>
On wing this species is more lively than the Forked-tailed, but less so
than the Common Stormy Petrel. It keeps its wings nearly at right angles
with its body, and makes considerable use of its feet, particularly
during calm weather, when it at times hops or leaps for several feet, or
pats the water, whilst its wings are extended upwards with a fluttering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_489' href='#Page_489'>489</a></span>
motion, and it inclines its head downwards to pick up its food from the
water, and I have observed it immerse the whole head beneath the surface,
to seize on small fishes, in which it generally succeeded. It can walk pretty
well on the deck of a vessel, or any other flat surface, and rise from it
without much difficulty. Its notes are different from that of the Forked-tailed
Petrel, and resembles the syllables <i>kee-re-kee kee</i>. They are more
frequently emitted at night than by day. I never could ascertain whether
or not these birds alight on the rigging at night, but my opinion is
that they do not, for the sailors, to whom I had offered premiums for
catching some of them, told me that although they flew about them while
aloft, they could not see one standing anywhere.
</p>

<p>
In my journal written on board the packet ship Columbia, commanded
by my worthy friend <span class="smcap">Joseph Delano</span>, Esq., I find the following memorandums:
“Wilson’s Petrel was first seen, this voyage, about two
hundred miles from England, and <i>alone</i> until we reached the middle of
the Atlantic, when the Forked-tailed came in sight, after which the latter
was most plentiful, and the pelagica by far the least numerous.” During
my several visits to the coasts of the Floridas, I saw scarcely any of
these birds in the course of several months spent there, but I found them
pretty abundant on returning towards Charleston. This species, like
the others, feeds on mollusca, small fishes, crustacea, marine plants, excrements
of cetaceous animals; and the greasy substances thrown from
vessels. When caught, they squirt an oily substance through the nostrils,
and often disgorge the same. The sexes are similar in their external
appearance.

<h2>
A LONG CALM AT SEA.
</h2>

<p>
On the 17th of May 1826, I left New Orleans on board the ship Delos,
commanded by <span class="smcap">Joseph Hatch</span>, Esq. of Kennebunk, bound for Liverpool.
The steamer Hercules, which towed the ship, left us several miles
outside the Balize, about ten hours after our departure; but there was
not a breath of wind, the waters were smoother than the prairies of the
Oppelousas, and notwithstanding our great display of canvass, we lay, like
a dead whale, floating at the mercy of the currents. The weather was
uncommonly fair, and the heat excessive; and in this helpless state we
continued for many days. About the end of a week we had lost sight of
the Balize, although I was assured by the commander, that all this while
the ship had rarely answered the helm. The sailors whistled for wind,
and raised their hands in all directions, anxious as they were to feel some
motion in the air; but all to no purpose; it was a dead calm, and we concluded
that Æolus had agreed with Neptune to detain us, until our
patience should be fairly tried, or our sport exhausted; for sport we certainly
had, both on board and around the ship. I doubt if I can better
contribute to your amusement at present, than by giving you a short account
of the occurrences that took place, during this sleepy fit of the
being on whom we depended for our progress toward merry England.
</p>

<p>
Vast numbers of beautiful dolphins glided by the side of the vessel,
glancing like burnished gold through the day, and gleaming like meteors
by night. The captain and his mates were expert at alluring them with
baited hooks, and not less so at piercing them with a five-pronged instrument,
which they called grains; and I was delighted with the sport, because
it afforded me an opportunity of observing and noting some of the
habits of this beautiful fish, as well as several other kinds.
</p>

<p>
On being hooked, the Dolphin flounces vigorously, shoots off with great
impetuosity to the very end of the line, when, being suddenly checked, it
often rises perpendicularly several feet out of the water, shakes itself
violently in the air, gets disentangled, and thus escapes. But when well
secured, it is held in play for a while by the experienced fisher, soon becomes
exhausted, and is hauled on board. Some persons prefer pulling
them in at once, but they seldom succeed, as the force with which the fish
shakes itself on being raised out of the water, is generally sufficient to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_492' href='#Page_492'>492</a></span>
enable it to extricate itself. Dolphins move in shoals, varying from four
or five to twenty or more, hunting in packs in the waters, as wolves pursue
their prey on land. The object of their pursuit is generally the Flying-fish,
now and then the Bonita; and when nothing better can be had,
they will follow the little Rudder-fish, and seize it immediately under the
stern of the ship. The Flying-fishes, after having escaped for a while by
dint of their great velocity, but on being again approached by the Dolphin,
emerge from the waters, and spreading their broad wing-like fins,
sail through the air and disperse in all directions, like a covey of timid
partridges before the rapacious falcon. Some pursue a direct course,
others diverge on either side; but in a short time they all drop into their
natural element. While they are travelling in the air, their keen and
hungry pursuer, like a greyhound, follows in their wake, and performing
a succession of leaps, many feet in extent, rapidly gains upon the quarry,
which is often seized just as it falls into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Dolphins manifest a very remarkable sympathy with each other. The
moment one of them is hooked or grained, those in company make up to
it, and remain around until the unfortunate fish is pulled on board, when
they generally move off together, seldom biting at any thing thrown out
to them. This, however, is the case only with the larger individuals,
which keep apart from the young, in the same manner as is observed in
several species of birds; for when the smaller Dolphins are in large shoals,
they all remain under the bows of a ship, and bite in succession at any
sort of line, as if determined to see what has become of their lost companions,
in consequence of which they are often all caught.
</p>

<p>
You must not suppose that the Dolphin is without its enemies. Who,
in this world, man or fish, has not enough of them? Often it conceives
itself on the very eve of swallowing a fish, which, after all, is nothing but
a piece of lead, with a few feathers fastened to it, to make it look like a
flying-fish, when it is seized and severed in two by the insidious Balacouda,
which I have once seen to carry off by means of its sharp teeth, the
better part of a Dolphin that was hooked, and already hoisted to the surface
of the water.
</p>

<p>
The Dolphins caught in the Gulf of Mexico during this calm were
suspected to be poisonous; and to ascertain whether this was really the
case, our cook, who was an African Negro, never boiled or fried one without
placing beside it a dollar. If the silver was not tarnished by the time
the Dolphin was ready for the table, the fish was presented to the passengers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_493' href='#Page_493'>493</a></span>
with an assurance that it was perfectly good. But as not a single
individual of the hundred that we caught had the property of converting
silver into copper, I suspect that our African sage was no magician.
</p>

<p>
One morning, that of the 22d of June, the weather sultry, I was surprised,
on getting out of my hammock, which was slung on deck, to find
the water all around swarming with Dolphins, which were sporting in
great glee. The sailors assured me that this was a certain “token of
wind,” and, as they watched the movement of the fishes, added, “aye,
and of a fair breeze too.” I caught several Dolphins in the course of an
hour, after which scarcely any remained about the ship. Not a breath of
air came to our relief all that day, no, nor even the next. The sailors
were in despair, and I would probably have become despondent also, had
not my spirits been excited by finding a very large Dolphin on my hook.
When I had hauled it on board, I found it to be the largest I had ever
caught. It was a magnificent creature. See how it quivers in the agonies
of death! its tail flaps the hard deck, producing a sound like the
rapid roll of a drum. How beautiful the changes of its colours! Now
it is blue, now green, silvery, golden, and burnished copper; now it presents
a blaze of all the hues of the rainbow intermingled; but, alack! it
is dead, and the play of its colours is no longer seen. It has settled into
the deep calm that has paralyzed the energies of the blustering winds,
and smoothed down the proud waves of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
The best bait for the Dolphin is a long stripe of shark’s flesh. I think
it generally prefers this to the semblance of a flying-fish, which indeed it
does not often seize unless when the ship is under weigh, and it is made
to rise to the surface. There are times, however, when hunger and the
absence of their usual food, will induce the Dolphins to dash at any sort
of bait; and I have seen some caught by means of a piece of white linen
fastened to a hook. Their appetite is as keen as that of the Vulture, and
whenever a good opportunity occurs, they gorge themselves to such a degree
that they become an easy prey to their enemies the Balacouda and
the Bottle-nosed Porpoise. One that had been grained while lazily swimming
immediately under the stern of our ship, was found to have its stomach
completely crammed with flying-fish, all regularly disposed side by
side, with their tails downwards,—by which I mean to say that the Dolphin
always <i>swallows its prey tail foremost</i>. They looked in fact like so
many salted herrings packed in a box, and were to the number of twenty-two,
each six or seven inches in length.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' href='#Page_494'>494</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The usual length of the Dolphins caught in the Gulf of Mexico is
about three feet, and I saw none that exceeded four feet two inches. The
weight of one of the latter size was only eighteen pounds; for this fish is
extremely narrow in proportion to its length, although rather deep in its
form. When just caught, the upper fin, which reaches from the forehead
to within a short distance of the tail, is of a fine dark blue. The upper part
of the body in its whole length is azure, and the lower parts are of a golden
hue, mottled irregularly with deep blue spots. It seems that they at
times enter very shallow water, as in the course of my last voyage along
the Florida coast, some were caught in a seine, along with their kinsman
the “Cavalier,” of which I shall speak elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The flesh of the Dolphin is rather firm, very white, and lies in flakes
when cooked. The first caught are generally eaten with great pleasure,
but when served many days in succession, they become insipid. It is not,
as an article of food, equal to the Balacouda, which is perhaps as good as
any fish caught in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

THE FRIGATE PELICAN.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXI. Adult.</span>

<p>
Previous to my visit to the Florida Keys, I had seen but few Frigate
Birds, and those only at some distance, while I was on the Gulf of
Mexico, so that I could merely recognise them by their mode of flight.
On approaching Indian Key, however, I observed several of them, and
as I proceeded farther south, their numbers rapidly increased; but on
the Tortugas very few were observed. This bird rarely travels farther
eastward than the Bay of Charleston in South Carolina, although it is
abundant at all seasons from Cape Florida to Cape Sable, the two extreme
points of the peninsula. How far south it may be found I cannot
tell.
</p>

<p>
The Frigate Pelicans may be said to be as gregarious as our Vultures:
You see them in small or large flocks, according to circumstances. Like
our Vultures, they spend the greater part of the day on wing, searching
for food; and like them also, when gorged or roosting, they collect in
large flocks, either to fan themselves or to sleep close together. They are
equally lazy, tyrannical, and rapacious, domineering over birds weaker
than themselves, and devouring the young of every species, whenever an
opportunity offers, in the absence of the parents; in a word, they are
most truly Marine Vultures.
</p>

<p>
About the middle of May, a period which to me appeared very late
for birds found in so warm a climate as that of the Florida Keys, the
Frigate Pelicans assemble in flocks of from fifty to five hundred pairs or
more. They are seen flying at a great height over the islands on which
they have bred many previous seasons, courting for hours together; after
which they return towards the mangroves, alight on them, and at once
begin to repair the old nests or construct new ones. They pillage each
other’s nests of their materials, and make excursions for more to the nearest
keys. They break the dry twigs of trees with ease, passing swiftly
on wing, and snapping them off by a single grasp of their powerful bill.
It is indeed a beautiful sight to see them when thus occupied, especially
when several are so engaged, passing and repassing with the swiftness of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_496' href='#Page_496'>496</a></span>
thought over the trees whose tops are blasted; their purpose appears as
if accomplished by magic. I know only two other birds that perform the
same action: one of them is the Forked-tailed Hawk, the other our swift
or Chimney Swallow; but neither of them is so expert as the Frigate
Pelican. It sometimes happens that this bird accidentally drops a stick
while travelling towards its nest, when, if this should happen over the
water, it plunges after it and seizes it with its bill before it has reached
the waves.
</p>

<p>
The nests are usually placed on the south side of the keys, and on
such trees as hang over the water, some low, others high, several in a
single tree, or only one, according to the size of the mangrove, but in
some cases lining the whole side of the island. They are composed of
sticks crossing each other to the height of about two inches, and are
flattish but not very large. When the birds are incubating, their long
wings and tail are seen extending beyond the nest for more than a foot.
The eggs are two or three, more frequently the latter number, measure
two inches and seven-eighths in length, two in breadth, being thus of a
rather elongated form, and have a thick smooth shell, of a greenish-white
colour, frequently soiled by the filth of the nests. The young are covered
with yellowish-white down, and look at first as if they had no feet. They
are fed by regurgitation, but grow tardily, and do not leave the nest until
they are able to follow their parents on wing.
</p>

<p>
At that period the plumage of the young females is marbled with grey
and brown, with the exception of the head and the lower parts, which are
white. The tail is about half the length it attains at the first moult, and
is brownish-black, as are the primaries. After the first change of plumage,
the wings become longer, and their flight is almost as elegant and
firm as that of older birds.
</p>

<p>
The second spring plumage of this sex is brownish-black on the upper
parts, that colour extending over the head and around the neck in
irregular patches of brown, continued in a sharp angle towards the breast,
but separated on its sides by the white that ascends on either side of the
neck towards the head. The lower tail-coverts are brownish-black, as
are the lower parts of the belly and flanks; the shoulders alone remaining
as at first. The tail and wings are perfect.
</p>

<p>
The third spring, the upper parts of the head and neck are of a purer
brownish-black, which extends down to the extremity of the angle, as are
the feathers of the belly and the lower tail-coverts, the dark colour reaching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' href='#Page_497'>497</a></span>
now to within five inches of the angle on the breast. The white of
the intermediate space has become much purer; here and there light tints
of bronze appear; the feet, which at first were dull yellow, have become of
a rich reddish-orange, and the bill is pale blue. The bird is now capable
of breeding, although its full plumage is not obtained until the next
moult, when the colours become glossy above, and the white of the breast
pure.
</p>

<p>
The changes which the males undergo are less remarkable. They
are at first, when fully fledged, entirely of the colour seen on the upper
parts of the young females; and the tint is merely improved afterwards,
becoming of a deeper brownish-black, and acquiring purer reflections of
green, purple and bronze, which in certain lights are seen on every part
of the head, neck and body, and in very old males on the wings and
tail. They also commence breeding the third spring. But I now return
to the habits of this interesting bird.
</p>

<p>
The Frigate Pelican is possessed of a power of flight which I conceive
superior to that of perhaps any other bird. However swiftly the Cayenne
Tern, the smaller Gulls or the Jager move on wing, it seems a matter of
mere sport to it to overtake any of them. The Goshawk, the Peregrine, and
the Gyr Falcon, which I conceive to be the swiftest of our hawks, are obliged
to pursue their victim, should it be a Green-winged Teal or Passenger
Pigeon, at times for half a mile, at the highest pitch of their speed, before
they can secure them. The bird of which I speak comes from on high with
the velocity of a meteor, and on nearing the object of its pursuit, which
its keen eye has spied while fishing at a distance, darts on either side
to cut off all retreat, and with open bill forces it to drop or disgorge
the fish which it has just caught. See him now! Yonder, over the
waves leaps the brilliant dolphin, as he pursues the flying-fishes, which
he expects to seize the moment they drop into the water. The Frigate
Bird, who has marked them, closes his wings, dives toward them, and now
ascending, holds one of the tiny things across his bill. Already fifty
yards above the sea, he spies a porpoise in full chase, launches towards
the spot, and in passing seizes the mullet that had escaped from its dreaded
foe; but now, having obtained a fish too large for his gullet, he rises,
munching it all the while, as if bound for the skies. Three or four of
his own tribe have watched him and observed his success. They shoot
towards him on broadly extended pinions, rise in wide circles, smoothly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' href='#Page_498'>498</a></span>
yet as swiftly as himself. They are now all at the same height, and each
as it overtakes him, lashes him with its wings, and tugs at his prey. See!
one has fairly robbed him, but before he can secure the contested fish
it drops. One of the other birds has caught it, but he is pursued by
all. From bill to bill, and through the air, rapidly falls the fish, until
it drops quite dead on the waters, and sinks into the deep. Whatever
disappointment the hungry birds feel, they seem to deserve it all.
</p>

<p>
Sights like these you may every day see, if you take ship and sail for
the Florida Keys. I have more to tell you, however, and of things that
to me were equally pleasing. While standing in the cool veranda of
Major <span class="smcap">Glassel</span> of the United States army, at Key West, I observed a
Frigate Pelican that had forced a Cayenne Tern, yet in sight, to drop a
fish, which the broad-winged warrior had seized as it fell. This fish was
rather large for the Tern, and might probably be about eight inches in
length. The Frigate Pelican mounted with it across his bill about a
hundred yards, and then tossing it up caught it as it fell, but not in the
proper manner. He therefore dropped it, but before it had fallen many
yards, caught it again. Still it was not in a good position, the weight of
the head, it seemed, having prevented the bird from seizing it by that
part. A second time the fish was thrown upwards, and now at last was
received in a convenient manner, that is, with its head downwards, and
immediately swallowed.
</p>

<p>
When the morning light gladdens the face of nature, and while
the warblers are yet waiting in silence the first rays of the sun, whose appearance
they will hail with songs of joy, the Frigate Bird, on extended
pinions, sails from his roosting place. Slowly and gently, with retracted
neck he glides, as if desirous of quietly trying the renovated strength of
his wings. Toward the vast deep he moves, rising apace, and before any
other bird views the bright orb emerging from the waters. Pure is the
azure of the heavens, and rich the deep green of the smooth sea below;
there is every prospect of the finest weather; and now the glad bird
shakes his pinions; and far up into the air, far beyond the reach of man’s
unaided eye, he soars in his quiet but rapid flight. There he floats in
the pure air, but thither can fancy alone follow him. Would that I could
accompany him! But now I see him again, with half-closed wings, gently
falling towards the sea. He pauses a while, and again dives through the
air. Thrice, four times, has he gradually approached the surface of the
ocean; now he shakes his pinions as violently as the swordsman whirls his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' href='#Page_499'>499</a></span>
claymore; all is right; and he sweeps away, shooting to this side and
that, in search of prey.
</p>

<p>
Mid-day has arrived, and threatening clouds obscure the horizon; the
breeze, ere felt, ruffles the waters around; a thick mist advances over the
deep; the sky darkens, and as the angry blasts curl the waves, the thunder
mutters afar; all nature is involved in gloom, and all is in confusion,
save only the Man-of-war Bird, who gallantly meets the gale. If he cannot
force his way against the storm, he keeps his ground, balancing himself
like a hawk watching his prey beneath; but now the tempest rages,
and rising obliquely, he shoots away, and ere long surmounts the tumultuous
clouds, entering a region calm and serene, where he floats secure
until the world below has resumed its tranquillity.
</p>

<p>
I have frequently observed the Frigate Bird scratch its head with its
feet while on wing; and this happening one day, when the bird fell through
the air, as it is accustomed to do at such times, until it came within shot, I
killed it when almost over my head, and immediately picked it up. I
had been for years anxious to know what might be the use of the pectinated
claws of birds; and on examining both its feet with a glass, I found
the racks crammed with insects, such as occur on the bird’s head, and especially
around the ears. I also observed that the pectinated claws of
birds of this species were much longer, flatter, and more comb-like than
those of any other species with which I am acquainted. I now therefore
feel convinced, that, however useful this instrument may be on other occasions,
it is certainly employed in cleansing parts of the skin of birds
which cannot be reached by the bill.
</p>

<p>
At times these birds may be seen chasing and jostling each other as if
engaged in a frolic, after which they bear away on extended wings, and
fly in a direct course until out of sight. But although their flight is easy
and powerful, in a degree not surpassed by any other bird, they move
with great difficulty on the ground. They can rise, however, from a sand-bar,
no matter how low and level it may be. At such times, as well as
when sitting on the water, which it occasionally does, the bird raises its
wings almost perpendicularly, spreads its tail half erect, and at the first
flap of the former, and simultaneous stroke of the latter, on the ground
or the water, bounces away. Its feet, however, are of little service beyond
what I have mentioned, and the supporting of its body when it has
alighted on a branch, on which it rarely stands very erect, although it
moves sideways on it, as Parrots sometimes do. It never dives, its bill
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' href='#Page_500'>500</a></span>
in form resembling that of the Cormorants, which also never plunge from
on wing in pursuit of fish, and only dip into the water when dropping
from a perch or a rock to escape danger, as the Anhingas and some other
birds are also accustomed to do.
</p>

<p>
When the Frigate Pelican is in want of a dead fish, a crab, or any
floating garbage suited to its appetite, it approaches the water in the manner
of Gulls, holding its wings high, and beating them until the bill has
performed its duty, which being accomplished, the bird immediately rises
in the air and devours its prey.
</p>

<p>
These birds see well at night, although they never go to sea excepting
by day. At various times I have accidentally sailed by mangrove
keys on which hundreds were roosted, and apparently sound asleep, when,
on my firing a gun for the purpose of starting whatever birds might be
there, they would all take to wing and sail as beautifully as during day,
returning to the trees as the boats proceeded. They are by no means
shy; indeed they seem unaware of danger from a gun, and rarely all go
off when a party is shooting at them, until a considerable number has
been obtained. The only difficulty I experienced in procuring them was
on account of the height to which they so soon rose on leaving the trees;
but we had excellent guns, and our worthy pilot’s “Long Tom” distinguished
itself above the rest. At one place, where we found many
hundreds of them, they sailed for nearly half an hour over our heads, and
about thirty were shot, some of them at a remarkable height, when we
could hear the shot strike them, and when, as they fell to the water, the
sound of their great wings whirling through the air resembled that produced
by a sail flapping during a calm. When shot at and touched ever
so slightly, they disgorge their food in the manner of Vultures, Gulls and
some Terns; and if they have fallen and are approached, they continue to
vomit the contents of their stomach, which at times are extremely putrid and
nauseous. When seized, they evince little disposition to defend themselves,
although ever so slightly wounded, but struggle and beat themselves until
killed. Should you, however, place your fingers within their open bill, you
might not withdraw them scatheless.
</p>

<p>
They are extremely silent, and the only note which I heard them
utter was a rough croaking one. They devour the young of the Brown
Pelican when quite small, as well as those of other birds whose nests are
flat and exposed during the absence of the parent birds; but their own
young suffer in the same manner from the still more voracious Turkey
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_501' href='#Page_501'>501</a></span>
Buzzard. The notion that the Frigate Bird forces the Pelicans and
Boobies to disgorge their prey is erroneous. The Pelican, if attacked or
pursued by this bird, could alight on the water or elsewhere, and by one
stroke of its sharp and powerful bill destroy the rash aggressor. The
Booby would in all probability thrust its strong and pointed bill against
the assailant with equal success. The Cayenne Tern, and other species
of that genus, as well as several small Gulls, all abundant on the Florida
coasts, are its purveyors, and them it forces to disgorge or drop their prey.
Those of the deep are the dolphins, porpoises, and occasionally the sharks.
Their sight is wonderfully keen, and they now and then come down from
a great height to pick up a dead fish only a few inches long floating on
the water. Their flesh is tough, dark, and, as food, unfit for any other
person than one in a state of starvation.
</p>

<p>
I have given a figure of a very beautiful old male in spring plumage,
which was selected from a great number of all ages. I have also represented
the feet of an individual between two and three years old, on account
of the richness of their colour at that age, whereas in the adult
males they are quite black.

The Adult Female differs from the male in several respects. The
former has the whole plumage dark-coloured, whereas the latter has a
broad white space on the breast, that colour extending forwards along
the sides of the neck, and encircling it about the middle. The feathers
of the back are less elongated and pointed, and their lustre is much inferior
to that of the male. The dark parts also are more tinged with
brown, and most of the smaller wing-coverts are of the latter colour.

This bird, though rare on the coast of the United States, visits the
shores of Massachusetts and Maine, where, during winter, it is seen over
the bays and inlets, to which various species of Gulls also resort at the
same season. It is more shy and difficult to be approached than the Pomarine
Jager. Its flight is rapid and greatly protracted; and, like the
other species of this genus, it harasses the smaller Gulls and Terns, forcing
them to disgorge their food. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that it
breeds in considerable numbers in the barren grounds, at a distance from
the coast, and that it feeds on testaceous mollusca, which are plentiful in
the small lakes of the fur countries. I am unable to afford any information
respecting its habits; nor can I state decidedly the number of eggs
which it lays, although I have procured several of them. They measure
two inches and three-eighths in length, by one inch and five-eighths in
breadth, are of an oval rather pointed form, and have a dull greyish-yellow
ground, patched with umber and faint purple, the markings closer
towards the larger end. I am extremely doubtful as to the right which
this bird has to rank as a species distinct from <i>L. parasiticus</i>.

<h2>
THE CAYENNE TERN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna cayana</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXIII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
On reaching the entrance of the little port of St Augustine in East
Florida, I observed more Cayenne Terns together than I had ever before
seen. I had afterwards good opportunities of watching them both during
that season and the following, about the Keys. Their shyness surprised
me not a little, especially as they are very seldom molested, and it was
such that I could study their habits only with the aid of a good glass. I
found them at first in great flocks, composed of several hundred individuals,
along with Razor-billed Shearwaters, which also congregated there in
great numbers. During low water, both species resorted to a large flat
sand-bar in the middle of the channel, where they reposed until the return
of the tide, sitting close together, in an easy posture, with their heads
facing the breeze. They kept separate, however, placing themselves in
parallel lines twenty or thirty paces asunder, and either lay flat on the
sand, or stood up and plumed themselves. My attempts to procure some
of them were always futile, for they flew off when I was yet several hundred
yards distant, and moved directly towards the sea. It was pleasing to
see the whole of these birds take to wing at the same moment, the jetty
hue of the Shearwaters contrasting with the pale blue of the Terns, and
the brilliantly-coloured bills of both species, their different modes of
flight, and their various evolutions presenting a most agreeable sight. The
Terns on these occasions constantly emitted their harsh loud cries, while
the Shearwaters moved in perfect silence. After spending several days
in unsuccessful endeavours to approach them, I employed several boats,
which advanced towards the sands at several points, and we shot as many
as we wished, for as the flocks passed over any of the boats, several individuals
were brought down at once, on which the rest would assail the
gunners, as if determined to rescue their brethren, and thus afford subjects
for them on which to exercise their skill. We found it necessary to
use large shot, the Cayenne Tern being a strong and tough bird, the largest
of the genus met with on our Atlantic coasts. When wounded, however
slightly, they disgorged in the manner of Vultures; and when brought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_506' href='#Page_506'>506</a></span>
to the water disabled, they at once endeavoured to make off from the
shores, swimming with buoyancy and grace, though without making much
progress. When seized they at once erected their beautiful crest, threw
up the contents of their stomach, uttered loud cries, and bit severely.
One that was merely touched in the wing, and brought ashore, through
a high surf, by my Newfoundland dog, stuck fast to his nose until forced
to relinquish its hold by having its throat squeezed, after which it disgorged
seven partially digested fishes.
</p>

<p>
Although the Cayenne Tern often searches for food over the sea, and
at times several miles from the shore, it gives a decided preference to the
large inlets running parallel to the coast of the Floridas, within the high
sandy embankments, as well as the rivers in the interior of the peninsula.
They alight on the banks of racoon oysters, so abundant in the inlets,
and are seen in company with the Semipalmated Snipe and the American
Oystercatcher, searching for food like these birds, and devouring crabs
and such fishes as are confined in small shallow pools. These they catch
with considerable agility, in a manner not employed by any of our other
Terns. While on the St John’s River, I saw them alight on stakes, in
the manner of the Marsh Tern and the Noddy; and as I ascended that
stream, I often saw them, at the distance of seventy miles from the sea,
perched in the middle of the river, on the same sticks as the Florida
Cormorants, and found them more easily approached in the dusk than
during broad daylight. Until then I had supposed this species to be entirely
oceanic, and averse from mingling with any other.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Cayenne Tern is strong and well sustained, although
less lively or graceful than that of the smaller species, excepting on particular
occasions. They usually incline their bill downwards, as they
search for their prey, like the other Terns, but keep at a much greater
height, and plunge towards the waters with the speed of an arrow, to seize
on small fishes, of which they appear to capture a great number, especially
of the “mullets,” which we saw moving about in shoals, composed
of individuals of different sizes. When travelling, these birds generally
proceed in lines; and it requires the power of a strong gale to force them
back, or even to impede their progress, for they beat to windward with
remarkable vigour, rising, falling, and tacking to right and left, so as to
seize every possible opportunity of making their way. In calm and pleasant
weather, they pass at a great height, with strong unremitted flappings,
uttering at intervals their cries, which so nearly resemble the shrieking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_507' href='#Page_507'>507</a></span>
notes of our little Parrakeet, that I have often for a moment thought
I heard the latter, when in fact it was only the Tern. At times their
cries resemble the syllables <i>kwee-reek</i>, repeated several times in succession,
and so loudly as to be heard at the distance of half a mile or more,
especially when they have been disturbed at their breeding places, on
which occasion they manifest all the characteristic violence of their tribe,
although they are much more guarded than any other species with which
I am acquainted, and generally keep at a considerable distance from their
unwelcome visitors.
</p>

<p>
On the 11th May 1832, I found the Cayenne Terns breeding on one
of the Tortugas. There they had dropped their eggs on the bare sand,
a few yards above high-water mark, and none of the birds paid much attention
to them during the heat of the day. You may judge of my surprise
when, on meeting with this Tern breeding on the coast of Labrador,
on the 18th of June 1833, I found it sitting on two eggs deposited in a nest
neatly formed of moss and placed on the rocks, and this on a small island, in
a bay more than twelve miles from our harbour, which itself was at some
distance from the open Gulf. On another equally sequestered islet,
some were found amidst a number of nests of our Common Gull; and,
during my stay in that country, I observed that this Tern rarely went
to the vicinity of the outer coast, for the purpose of procuring food, probably
because there was an extreme abundance of small fishes of several
kinds in every creek or bay. Until that period I was not aware that any
Tern could master the <i>Lestris Pomarinus</i>, to which, however, I there saw
the Cayenne Tern give chase, driving it away from the islands on which
it had its eggs. On such occasions, I observed that the Tern’s power of
flight greatly exceeded that of the Jager; but the appearance of the
Great Black-backed Gull never failed to fill it with dismay, for although
of quicker flight, none of the Terns dared to encounter that bird, any
more than they would venture to attack the Frigate Pelican in the
Floridas.
</p>

<p>
The Cayenne Tern usually lays two eggs; in a few instances I found
only one, and I concluded that no more had been laid, as it contained a
chick, which would not have been there had the Great Gull ever visited
the nest. The eggs measure two inches and six-eighths in length, by
one inch and six and a half eighths in breadth, and are rather sharp at
the smaller end. They have a pale yellowish ground colour, irregularly
spotted with dark umber and faint purplish marks, dispersed all over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_508' href='#Page_508'>508</a></span>
but not close. The eggs, like those of the other species, afford good
eating.
</p>

<p>
I never saw the young of this bird while small, and cannot speak of
the changes which they undergo from their first state until autumn.
Then, however, they greatly resemble the young of the Sandwich Tern,
their colour being on the upper parts of a dark greyish-brown, transversely
marked with umber, and on the lower dull white. While in this
plumage, they keep by themselves, in flocks of fifty or more individuals,
and remain separated from the old birds until spring, when they have
acquired the full beauty of their plumage, although they appear rather
inferior in size.
</p>

<p>
My surprise at finding this species breeding in Labrador was increased
by the circumstance of its being of rare occurrence at any season along
the coasts of our Middle and Eastern Districts. Nor does it become
abundant until you reach the shores of North Carolina, beyond which it
increases the farther south you proceed. It winters in the Floridas, and
along the shores of the Mexican Gulf; but I never saw it far up the
Mississippi. While on the coast of Newfoundland, on the 14th of
August, I saw several individuals on their way southward, flying very
high, and keeping up their remarkable cries.
</p>

<p>
The flesh of every species of Tern is oily, like that of the Gulls and
Jagers, and the smallest hole made by shot affords an exit to the grease,
which is apt to destroy the beauty of their elastic plumage, so that it is
very difficult to preserve them, both on account of this circumstance, and
of the quantity of oil that flows from their bill. In no species have I
found this to be more remarkably the case than in the Cayenne Tern.

<h2>
THE SEMIPALMATED SNIPE, OR WILLET.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Totanus semipalmatus</i>, Temm.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXIV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
Many individuals of this fine species spend the winter in our Southern
States, and the extent of its migration northwards is comparatively limited.
Some are occasionally seen as far eastward as the neighbourhood of
Boston, and a few have been known to breed not far from New Bedford in
Massachusetts; but beyond that state the species may be said to be unknown.
Their propensity to remain at all seasons in the immediate vicinity
of the coast is such, that they are very seldom met with far inland,
even along large rivers, on the margins of which they might find the food
they usually prefer. I once shot one in autumn on the lower part of the
Ohio, but it was much emaciated, and I concluded that its appearance
there was merely accidental. From the mouth of the Mississippi to New
York it is pretty generally found during the breeding season; but all the
individuals betake themselves in winter to the shores of Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, and the countries bordering the Mexican Gulf. I have very
little doubt that those seen by Mr <span class="smcap">Say</span> on the banks of the Missouri had
accidentally visited that country, as the favourite haunts of this species at
all seasons are the salt-marshes and sea-shores. It is well ascertained that
it occurs on the western coast, and I have seen many skins of it recently
brought from the mouth of the Columbia River. It is probably from
thence that it migrates to the shores of the Saskatchewan, where it was
observed by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> along the small saline lakes.
</p>

<p>
In the Middle States, the Semipalmated Snipe is known to every fisherman
gunner by the name of “Willet;” and from the Carolinas southward
by that of “Stone Curlew.” In the latter districts, during autumn
and winter, it resorts to the stony shores of estuaries, the banks of racoon
oysters, and the extensive salt-marshes so common there along the coast.
On the 1st of May 1832, while rambling over some large and partially
submersed islets of the Floridas called Duck Keys, scantily covered with
bushes and some mangroves, I saw a good number of these birds in company
with the Great Marbled Godwit. The Willets were all paired
and very clamorous, although we found none of their nests. To my great
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_511' href='#Page_511'>511</a></span>
surprise, I saw them alight on the bushes and trees with as much ease as
if they had been land birds, stand erect, open their wings to the sun, and
await our approach, exhibiting, when thus perched, much less shyness
than when on the ground. Until then I had never observed such a habit
in this bird, and indeed had felt surprised at seeing the Bartram Snipe,
<i>Totanus Bartramius</i>, alight on fences and trees. Nothing of this kind is
mentioned by <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, who, however, speaks of both species as if he were
well acquainted with their habits. A few days after my visit to the Duck
Keys, some nests containing eggs were found on other islets not far distant.
</p>

<p>
Along the shores of the Carolinas, this species begins to lay about the
beginning of April; but in the Middle States, in New Jersey, for example,
it seldom makes its appearance before the 15th of April, and does not begin
to breed until a month later. At the approach of the love season,
the Willets shew a great degree of vivacity, ramble much on wing, and
fill the air with their sharp cries. Once mated, they attend to the security
of their eggs and brood with affectionate care, and are silent until disturbed
by the approach of some of their numerous enemies. The sight
of a Crow, a Turkey Buzzard, a quadruped of any kind, and more especially
of a gunner, at once excites the greatest alarm; and, rising on wing,
they fly above and around you at a considerable distance, vociferating
their anger with great vehemence, and continually endeavouring to allure
you away from the spot where their treasure is concealed. Should they
have young broods, they not unfrequently alight within sight, emit clicking
and querulous notes, raise their wings upright, and run over the
ground as if wounded, moving in so pitiable a manner as frequently to
excite a good feeling towards them in the gunner, who, should he be a
parent himself, is almost sure to leave them unmolested. When much
pursued, the birds join and form a flock, the individuals of which continue
to wheel through the air, at some distance from their nests, until
their enemy has departed.
</p>

<p>
The Semipalmated Snipe is at all times a shy and wary bird, so that
in approaching it the sportsman requires to use the greatest caution. The
method which I found most effectual was to employ a well-trained dog,
and conceal myself among the rankest herbage of the marshes. The
Willets rarely failed to fly close over the dog, and as he now and then,
playfully, as it were, approached me, the birds came within shooting distance.
On such occasions, if one is brought down, another may follow,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_512' href='#Page_512'>512</a></span>
provided the sportsman is quick; but, after being thus shot at, the Willets
generally take a long circuit, and remove towards some clear spot near
the water, where they alight and watch your motions. The cries of one
suffice to alarm all within hearing, and you see all of them with outstretched
legs and necks running away as you approach. Often at the
very instant when you are preparing to shoot, they all rise on wing, fly
across some bay or creek, and betake themselves to the marsh, where they
are safe from your pursuit.
</p>

<p>
During winter you frequently see these birds in the Southern States
along the naked shores. The moment they see you the cry of alarm is
sounded, and the flock, which now consists of one, two, or perhaps three
families, suffer you to come almost within shot, as if purposely to tantalize
you, but at this moment fly off circuitously over the water, and alight
at the distance of some hundred yards. At such times you may procure
them by floating your boat quietly along the shores; but the experiment
rarely succeeds on the same flock more than once. When they are on
large racoon-oyster beds, it is almost impossible to approach them; and
if there should be a few Curlews or Oyster-catchers among them, it were
better for you to go in search of some other game.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species is strong, rapid, and greatly protracted. Its
movements on wing greatly resemble those of the Oyster-catcher, and,
unless during the breeding season, are performed low over the waters.
They seldom rise without emitting their usual notes, which resemble the
syllables <i>will-willet</i>, or <i>will</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>willet</i>, and are different from the softer
and more prolonged whistling notes which they emit during the love season.
They generally travel in flocks, even in spring, and congregate for
the purpose of breeding, being attracted when passing by the notes of
those which have already arrived at a chosen spot. The males and females
remain together until autumn, when several families join and live peaceably
together. When wounded and brought to the water, they swim
tolerably well, but do not dive, although they now and then, on being
approached, try to submerse themselves.
</p>

<p>
The Willets retire to the interior of the larger salt-marshes for the
purpose of forming their nests and raising their broods in security. There,
in the vicinity of the shallow pools, which frequently occur in such places,
the bird prepares a nest on the ground, among the rank grass, of which the
tenement itself is composed. It is usually raised to the height of from
three to five inches, and is, I believe, annually augmented or repaired.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_513' href='#Page_513'>513</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Wilson</span> says that this augmentation or raising of the nest is carried on
whilst the Willet is laying and sitting; but this I have never observed.
The eggs, usually four in number, are placed with the broad end outwards,
as is the case with those of most birds of this tribe. They measure two
inches and one-eighth in length, by one inch and a half in breadth, are
much flattened at the larger end, and more or less pointed at the other.
The shell is smooth, of a dull yellowish-olive tint, irregularly spotted and
blotched with dark umber. The eggs afford excellent eating. Both birds
incubate, sitting alternately day and night. The young run about on
leaving the shell, and are carefully fed by their parents. They are of a
greyish hue, and covered with down, but soon shew feathers, grow rapidly,
become fat and juicy, and by the time they are able to fly, afford excellent
food. At the first moult they acquire their full plumage.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Willet consists of aquatic insects, small crabs, and
fiddlers, which they procure either by pursuing them on foot or by probing
for them in their burrows, along the mud bars, and in the crevices of
the creeks and salt-water ditches. I have also observed it turning over
stones and shells to seek for worms beneath them.
</p>

<p>
The males are smaller than the females. I have presented you with
figures of the adult both in the winter and summer plumage.

<h2>
THE NODDY TERN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna stolida</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXV.</span>
</p>

<p>
About the beginning of May, the Noddies collect from all parts of
the Gulf of Mexico, and the coasts of Florida, for the purpose of returning
to their breeding places, on one of the Tortugas called Noddy
Key. They nearly equal in number the Sooty Terns, which also breed on
an island a few miles distant. The Noddies form regular nests of twigs
and dry grass, which they place on the bushes or low trees, but never on the
ground. On visiting their island on the 11th of May 1832, I was surprised
to see that many of them were repairing and augmenting nests that had remained
through the winter, while others were employed in constructing new
ones, and some were already sitting on their eggs. In a great many instances,
the repaired nests formed masses nearly two feet in height, and
yet all of them had only a slight hollow for the eggs, broken shells of
which were found among the entire ones, as if they had been purposely
placed there. The birds did not discontinue their labours, although there
were nine or ten of us walking among the bushes, and when we had gone
a few yards into the thicket, thousands of them flew quite low over us,
some at times coming so close as to enable us to catch a few of them with
the hand. On one side might be seen a Noddy carrying a stick in its bill,
or a bird picking up something from the ground to add to its nest; on
the other several were seen sitting on their eggs unconscious of danger,
while their mates brought them food. The greater part rose on wing as
we advanced, but re-alighted as soon as we had passed. The bushes were
rarely taller than ourselves, so that we could easily see the eggs in the nests.
This was quite a new sight to me, and not less pleasing than unexpected.
</p>

<p>
The Noddy, like most other species of Terns, lays three eggs, which
average two inches in length, by an inch and three-eighths in breadth, and
are of a reddish-yellow colour, spotted and patched with dull red and faint
purple. They afford excellent eating, and our sailors seldom failed to collect
bucketfuls of them daily during our stay at the Tortugas. The
wreckers assured me that the young birds remain along with the old
through the winter, in which respect the Noddy, if this account be correct,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_517' href='#Page_517'>517</a></span>
differs from other species, the young of which keep by themselves until
spring.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of a boat, the Noddies never flew off their island, in
the manner of the Sooty Terns. They appeared to go farther out to sea
than those birds, in search of their food, which consists of fishes mostly
caught amid the floating sea-weeds, these Terns seizing them, not by plunging
perpendicularly downwards, as other species do, but by skimming
close over the surface in the manner of Gulls, and also by alighting and
swimming round the edges of the weeds. This I had abundant opportunities
of seeing while on the Gulf of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this bird greatly resembles that of the Night Hawk
when passing over meadows or rivers. When about to alight on the
water, the Noddy keeps its wings extended upwards, and touches it first
with its feet. It swims with considerable buoyancy and grace, and at
times immerses its head to seize on a fish. It does not see well by night,
and it is perhaps for this reason that it frequently alights on the spars of
vessels, where it sleeps so sound that the seamen often catch them. When
seized in the hand, it utters a rough cry, not unlike that of a young
American Crow taken from the nest. On such occasions, it does not disgorge
its food, like the Cayenne Tern and other species, although it bites
severely, with quickly repeated movements of the bill, which, on missing
the object aimed at, snaps like that of our larger Fly-catchers. Some
which I kept several days, refused all kinds of food, became dull and
languid, and at length died.
</p>

<p>
While hovering over us near their nests, these birds emitted a low
querulous murmur, and, if unmolested, would attempt to alight on our
heads. After a few visits, however, they became rather more careful of
themselves, although the sitting birds often suffered us to put a hat over
them. Like the Sooty Tern, this species incubates both day and night.
The differences exhibited by Terns with respect to their mode of nestling
and incubation, are great, even in the same neighbourhood, and under the
same degree of atmospheric temperature. This species breeds on bushes
or low trees, placing several nests on the same bush, or in fact as many
as it will hold. The <i>Sterna fuliginosa</i> scoops out a slight hollow in the
sand, under the bushes, without forming any nest, and incubates closely
like the former. The Sandwich, the Cayenne, and the Roseate Terns,
drop their eggs on the sand or the bare rock, and seldom sit upon them
until evening, or during cloudy or rainy weather. The Cayenne, Sooty,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_518' href='#Page_518'>518</a></span>
and Noddy Terns differ greatly in their flight, their manner of feeding,
and the extent of their migrations. The Tail of the Noddy is cuneate,
instead of being forked, in which respect it differs essentially from that of
the other species. Perhaps the naturalists who placed it in the same genus
with the Roseate Tern, may have been nodding over their books.
</p>

<p>
Since writing the above account, I have read the article on this species
by my esteemed friend Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>, and am surprised to find
him state that “the Noddies breed in great numbers in the Bahama
Islands, laying their eggs on the shelvings of rocks.” No authority is
given for this, which I regret, because had he given the fact as observed
by himself, it would have astonished me as much as my account of the
breeding of the Noddy in the Tortugas may astonish others.

<h2>
STILL BECALMED.
</h2>

<p>
On the 4th of June we were still in the same plight, although the currents
of the Gulf had borne us to a great distance from the place where,
as I have informed you, we had amused ourselves with catching Dolphins.
These currents are certainly very singular, for they carried us hither and
thither, at one time rendering us apprehensive of drifting on the coast of
Florida, at another threatening to send us to Cuba. Sometimes a slight
motion in the air revived our hopes, swelled our sails a little, and carried
us through the smooth waters like a skater gliding on ice; but in a few
hours it was again a dead calm.
</p>

<p>
One day several small birds, after alighting on the spars, betook themselves
to the deck. One of them, a female Rice Bunting, drew our attention
more particularly, for, a few moments after her arrival, there came
down, as if in her wake, a beautiful Peregrine Falcon. The plunderer
hovered about for a while, then stationed himself on the end of one of
the yard-arms, and suddenly pouncing on the little gleaner of the meadows,
clutched her and carried her off in exultation. But, Reader, mark
the date, and judge besides of my astonishment when I saw the Falcon
feeding on the Finch while on wing, precisely with the same ease and
composure as the Mississippi Kite might shew while devouring high in
air a Red-throated Lizard, swept from one of the magnificent trees of the
Louisiana woods.
</p>

<p>
There was a favourite pet on board, belonging to our Captain, and
which was nothing more nor less than the female companion of a cock, in
other words, a common hen. Some liked her because she now and then
dropped a fresh egg,—a rare article at sea, even on board the Delos;
others, because she exhibited a pleasing simplicity of character; others
again, because, when they had pushed her overboard, it gave them pleasure
to see the poor thing in terror strike with her feet, and strive to reach
her floating home, which she would never have accomplished, however,
had it not been for the humane interference of our Captain, Mr <span class="smcap">Joseph
Hatch</span> of Kennebunk. Kind, good-hearted man! when, several weeks
after, the same pet hen accidentally flew overboard, as we were scudding
along at a furious rate, I thought I saw a tear stand in his eye, as she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_521' href='#Page_521'>521</a></span>
floated panting in our wake.—But as yet we are becalmed, and heartily
displeased at old Æolus for overlooking us.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon we caught two sharks. In one of them, a female, about
seven feet long, we found ten young ones, all alive, and quite capable of
swimming, as we proved by experiment; for, on casting one of them into
the sea, it immediately made off, as if it had been accustomed to shift for
itself. Of another, that had been cut in two, the head half swam off out
of our sight. The rest were cut in pieces, as was the old shark, as bait
for the dolphins, which I have already said are fond of such food.
</p>

<p>
Our captain, who was much intent on amusing me, informed me that
the rudder-fishes were plentiful astern, and immediately set to dressing
hooks for the purpose of catching them. There was now some air above
us, the cotton sheets aloft bulged out, the ship moved through the water,
and the captain and I repaired to the cabin window. I was furnished
with a fine hook, a thread line, and some small bits of bacon, as was the
captain, and we dropped our bait among the myriads of delicate little
fishes below. Up they came, one after another, so fast in succession, that,
according to my journal, we caught three hundred and seventy in about
two hours. What a mess! and how delicious when roasted! If ever I
am again becalmed in the Gulf of Mexico, I shall not forget the rudder-fish.
The little things scarcely measured three inches in length; they
were thin and deep in form, and afforded excellent eating. It was curious
to see them keep to the lee of the rudder in a compact body; and so
voracious were they, that they actually leaped out of the water at the
sight of the bait, as “sunnies” are occasionally wont to do in our rivers.
But the very instant that the ship became still, they dispersed around her
sides, and would no longer bite. I made a figure of one of them, as indeed
I tried to do of every other species that occurred during this death-like
calm. Not one of these fishes did I ever see when crossing the Atlantic,
although many kinds at times come close to the stern of any vessel
in the great sea, and are called by the same name.
</p>

<p>
Another time we caught a fine Porpoise, which measured about two
yards in length. This took place at night, when the light of the moon
afforded me a clear view of the spot. The fish, contrary to custom, was
grained, instead of being harpooned; but in such a way and so effectually,
through the forehead, that it was thus held fast, and allowed to flounce
and beat about the bows of the ship, until the person who had struck it
gave the line holding the grains to the Captain, slided down along the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_522' href='#Page_522'>522</a></span>
bob-stays with a rope, and after a while managed to secure it by the tail.
Some of the crew then hoisted it on board. When it arrived on deck, it
gave a deep groan, flapped with great force, and soon expired. On
opening it next morning, eight hours after death, we found its intestines
still warm. They were arranged in the same manner as those of a pig;
the paunch contained several cuttlefishes partially digested. The lower
jaw extended beyond the upper about three-fourths of an inch, and both
were furnished with a single row of conical teeth, about half an inch long,
and just so far separated as to admit those of one jaw between the corresponding
ones of the other. The animal might weigh about four hundred
pounds; its eyes were extremely small, its flesh was considered delicate
by some on board; but in my opinion, if it be good, that of a large alligator
is equally so; and on neither do I intend to feast for some time.
The Captain told me that he had seen these Porpoises leap at times perpendicularly
out of the water to the height of several feet, and that small
boats have now and then been sunk by their falling into them, when engaged
with their sports.
</p>

<p>
During all this time flocks of Pigeons were crossing the Gulf, between
Cuba and the Floridas; many a Rose-breasted Gull played around by
day; Noddies alighted on the rigging by night; and now and then, the
Frigate bird was observed ranging high over head in the azure of the
cloudless sky.
</p>

<p>
The directions of the currents were tried, and our Captain, who had
an extraordinary genius for mechanics, was frequently employed in turning
powder horns and other articles. So calm and sultry was the weather
that we had a large awning spread, under which we took our meals, and
spent the night. At length we got so wearied of it, that the very sailors
I thought seemed disposed to leap overboard, and swim to land. But
at length, on the thirty-seventh day after our departure, a smart breeze
overtook us. Presently there was an extraordinary bustle on board;
about twelve the Tortugas light-house bore north of us, and in a few
hours more we gained the Atlantic. Æolus had indeed awakened from
his long sleep; and on the nineteenth day after leaving the Capes of
Florida, I was landed at Liverpool.

This beautiful species rarely advances farther south along our eastern
coast than the neighbourhood of the Bay of Boston. I have, however, been
assured by old and trustworthy gunners that the King Duck, about thirty
years ago, was by no means of rare occurrence there during winter, and that
a few had been known to breed in company with the Eider along the coast.
At the period of my arrival at Labrador, the greater number of the King
Ducks had proceeded farther north; and although some were seen there,
we found none of their nests. I can say nothing of the habits of this
bird, which, although they may be similar to those of the Eider, must
yet differ in many particulars, as is the case with all birds that are nearly
allied in form. The eggs of the King Duck collected by Captain <span class="smcap">James
Clark Ross</span>, R. N., measure two inches and five-eighths by one inch and
three-fourths, and have a smooth shell, of an uniform dull greenish-colour.

The Female differs greatly from the male. The bill is shorter, its
tumid basal lobes narrow and not ascending perpendicularly, so that the
forehead is low as in most Ducks. The feathers of the head and upper
part of the neck are small, soft, and uniform. The colour of the bill is
pale greenish-grey; the iris dull yellow; the feet dull ochre. The head
and neck are pale greyish-yellow, with small lines of brownish-black.
The feathers of the back are brownish-black towards the end, with yellowish-grey
edges, the scapulars brownish-red on the margins. The quills
and tail-feathers are deep greyish-brown; the recurved secondaries broadly
edged externally with yellowish-grey. The fore part of the lower neck
and breast, the sides, and lower tail-coverts, have a central mark and submarginal
band of brownish-black, the middle of the breast scarcely spotted,
being of the general colour of the lower parts, which is pale yellowish-brown.

<p>
In the first article in this volume, that of the Canada Goose, in which I
have described the habits of that bird at considerable length, I had occasion
to allude to a small species called by the gunners of Maine the Winter
or Flight Goose, which they described to me as resembling the large and
common kind in almost every particular except its size. Although it was
not my good fortune while there to meet with the bird spoken of by men
who were well acquainted with it, I have no doubt that it is the very species
which has been named in honour of Mr <span class="smcap">Hutchins</span>, and that its periodical
appearance along our eastern coast will ere long be fully established. This
is the more to be expected as Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that it is abundant
about Hudson’s Bay, where it was long mistaken for the Brent, or an
emaciated Canada Goose. In the mean time, having been presented with
a specimen of the bird in question by my highly esteemed and gallant
friend Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span>, I have embraced the opportunity thus
offered, of laying before you a representation, the first I believe that has
yet appeared, of <span class="smcap">Hutchins</span>’s Goose.
</p>

<p>
For fifteen months, rendered trebly long and wearisome by heavy and
difficult marches, under the most distressing feelings, that most amiable
and accomplished traveller, carried with him many specimens of rare birds,
with the view of contributing to the advancement of our knowledge.
Would, Reader, that you could sympathize with me in the feelings of
pride and pleasure with which I call him friend. May his name be as
extensively known as his worth deserves!
</p>

<p>
Some weeks after my drawing was finished, and when I had arrived
in Edinburgh, I had the gratification of receiving a long and most interesting
letter from him, of which I present you with an extract. “I
have very great pleasure in having it now in my power to offer to your
acceptance the specimen of this interesting species from which your drawing
was taken. It was the child of my solicitude, and my constant companion
during a long and tedious journey, after the abandonment of
our ship, until our being received on board the Isabella, an interval of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_527' href='#Page_527'>527</a></span>
fifteen months; and this will account in a great measure for the miserable
plight in which the specimen first came into your hands. I will dispose
of it according to your wishes, and am most happy to place it in the
hands of one who knows so well how to appreciate the interesting associations
connected with it.
</p>

<p>
“These birds arrived in flocks about the middle of June, in the neighbourhood
of Felix Harbour, and soon dispersed in pairs to their breeding
place. At Igloolik, the only place where we had before met with them,
their nests were found in the marshes near the sea; but on this occasion
several pairs constructed their nests on a ledge of rock near the foot of a
high precipice; immediately above them the Dovekies, Loons, several
species of Gulls, and near its summit, the Jer-Falcon and Raven, built
their nests.
</p>

<p>
“From three to four eggs were found in each nest, of a pure white, and
of an oval form, measuring 3.1 inches by 2.1, and weighing from 1800 to
2000 grains.
</p>

<p>
“The female bird is smaller than the male. To the measurements given
by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, which are very accurate, we may add that its extent
of wings is fifty inches, and that it averages about four pounds and a half
of weight. Its flesh is of a most exquisite flavour.”

Although I have met with this species at different times in Kentucky,
and along our extensive shores, from the Floridas to Maine, as well as on
the coast of Labrador, I never found it breeding. Indeed, I have not
met with it in the United States excepting in the latter part of autumn
and in winter. Those procured in Labrador were shot in the beginning of
August, and were all young birds, apparently about to take their departure.
My drawing of the two individuals represented in the plate was
made at St Augustine in East Florida, where I procured them on the 2d
December 1831. I have always found these birds gentle and less shy than
any other species of the genus. They fly at a considerable height with
rapidity, deviating alternately to either side, and plunge toward the ground
in a manner somewhat resembling that of the Solitary Sandpiper. When
accidentally surprised, they start with a repeated <i>weet</i>, less sonorous than
that of the bird just mentioned. They search for food along the margins
of pools, creeks and rivers, or by the edges of sand-bars, and mix
with other species.

THE SANDWICH TERN.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna cantiaca</i>, Gmel</span>.
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXIX. Adult and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of May 1832, while sailing along the Florida Keys in
Mr <span class="smcap">Thruston</span>’s barge, accompanied by his worthy pilot and my assistant,
I observed a large flock of Terns, which, from their size and other
circumstances, I would have pronounced to be Marsh Terns, had not the
difference in their manner of flight convinced me that they were of a species
hitherto unknown to me. The pleasure which one feels on such an
occasion cannot easily be described, and all that it is necessary for me to
say on the subject at present is, that I begged to be rowed to them as
quickly as possible. A nod and a wink from the pilot satisfied me that
no time should be lost, and in a few minutes all the guns on board were
in requisition. The birds fell around us; but as those that had not been
injured remained hovering over their dead and dying companions, we
continued to shoot until we procured a very considerable number. On
examining the first individual picked up from the water, I perceived from
the yellow point of its bill that it was different from any that I had
previously seen, and accordingly shouted “A prize! a prize! a new
bird to the American Fauna!” And so it was, good Reader, for no person
before had found the Sandwich Tern on any part of our coast. A
large basket was filled with them, and we pursued our course. On opening
several individuals, I found in the females eggs nearly ready for being
laid. The males, too, manifested the usual symptoms of increased action
in the organs distinctive of the sex. I felt a great desire to discover
their breeding grounds, which I had the pleasure of doing in a few days
after.
</p>

<p>
The vigour and activity of this bird while on wing afforded me great
pleasure. Indeed its power of flight exceeds that of the Marsh Tern,
which I consider as a closely allied species. While travelling, it advances
by regular sharp flappings of its wings, which propel it forward much in
the manner of the Passenger Pigeon, when, single and remote from a flock,
it pushes on with redoubled speed. While plunging after the small mullets
and other diminutive fishes that form the principal part of its food, it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_532' href='#Page_532'>532</a></span>
darts perpendicularly downwards with all the agility and force of the
Common and Arctic Terns, nearly immersing its whole body at times,
but rising instantly after, and quickly regaining a position from which it
can advantageously descend anew. Should the fish disappear, as the bird
is descending, the latter instantly recovers itself without plunging into the
water. Its cries are sharp, grating, and loud enough to be heard at the
distance of half a mile. They are repeated at intervals while it is travelling,
and kept up incessantly when one intrudes upon it in its breeding
grounds, on which occasion it sails and dashes over your head, chiding you
with angry notes more disagreeable than pleasant to your ear.
</p>

<p>
How many days these birds had been laying, when I discovered the
key on which they breed, I cannot say; but many of them were still engaged
in depositing their eggs, and none were as yet sitting on those
which, being three together, seemed to form the full complement. They
had been dropped on the sand, at short intervals, with scarcely any appearance
of a hollow for their reception. In some instances they were laid
at the foot of a scanty tuft of grass; but all were fully exposed to the
heat of the sun, which at this time I thought almost sufficient to cook
them. The eggs varied as much in colour as those of the Arctic Tern and
Foolish Guillemot, and were equally disproportionate to the size of the bird,
their average length being two inches and one-eighth, their greatest breadth
one inch and three and a half eighths. They are of an oval form, but rather
sharp at the larger end. The ground colour is yellowish-grey, varying
in depth, and all more or less spotted, blotched, or marked with different
tints of umber, pale blue, and reddish. But to describe them with
absolute precision seems to me impossible, and until you see my plates of
eggs, I strongly recommend to you to inspect the valuable and accurate
delineations published by my friend <span class="smcap">W. C. Hewitson</span>, Esq. of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
among which you will find not less than three excellent representations
of the eggs of the Sandwich Tern. That gentleman describes
them as being “mostly two” for each pair of birds, and “sometimes
three,” on the islands on the coast of Northumberland, where he found
this species breeding in numbers. The eggs were so abundant and close
together, that, to use his own words, “we were obliged carefully to pick
our steps in order to avoid treading upon them; they were either on the
grass as it grew, or upon a small quantity gathered together for that purpose.”
I add that these eggs are most capital eating.
</p>

<p>
I never saw the Sandwich Tern on any other portion of our coasts than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_533' href='#Page_533'>533</a></span>
between the Florida Keys and Charleston, and from whence it first came
there, or how it went thence to Europe, is an enigma which may perhaps
never be solved. On asking the Wreckers if they had been in the habit
of seeing these birds, they answered in the affirmative, and added that
they paid them pretty frequent visits during the breeding season, on account
of their eggs as well as of the young, which, when nearly able to
fly, they said were also good eating. According to their account, this species
spends the whole winter near and upon the keys, and the young keep
separate from the old birds.

and the tail; the four outer quills blackish, but covered with light grey
down, on the outer webs and over a considerable extent of the inner, their
shafts white.

<h2>
THE BLACK TERN.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Sterna nigra</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXX. Adult Male and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Black Tern begins to arrive from the Mexican territories over
the waters of the Western Country, about the middle of April, and continues
to pass for about a month. At that season I have observed it ascending
the Mississippi from New Orleans to the head waters of the Ohio,
then cutting over the land, and arriving at the Great Lakes, beyond
which many proceed still farther northward. But I have rarely met
with them along our Atlantic shores until autumn, when the young, which,
like those of all other Terns with which I am acquainted, mostly keep by
themselves until spring, make their appearance there. Nor did I see a
single individual when on my way to Labrador, or during my visit to
that country. They re-appear in the Western Country, in the course of
their southern migration, in the months of September and October; but
many pairs breed in the intermediate range.
</p>

<p>
When residing at Louisville in Kentucky, I found the Black Tern
abundant in the neighbourhood, breeding on the margins of ponds at a
short distance from the Ohio. I also found them with nests and eggs on
a pond near Vincennes, in the State of Indiana. Now, however, they
have abandoned those places, and merely pass over the country on their
way to and from the northern regions.
</p>

<p>
Often have I watched their graceful light and rapid flight, as they
advanced and passed over in groups of twenty, thirty or more, from the
delightful residence of my worthy friend and kind relative <span class="smcap">Nicholas
Berthoud</span>, Esq. of Shippingport, during the month of May, when Nature,
opening her stores anew, benignly smiled upon the favoured land
of Kentucky. The gay birds were seen ranging from the basin at the
foot of the rapids to the lower part of the narrow channel which separates
Sandy Island from the shore, up the clear stream and down again, plunging
at short intervals into the water to seize their prey, and continuing
their pleasing occupations through the whole day. When the period of
reproduction arrived, they would all betake themselves to the ponds, and
search along their moist shores for tufts of rank grass such as might form
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_536' href='#Page_536'>536</a></span>
suitable places for their nests. One of their favourite ponds still remains
in part, although a great portion of it has been drained. It is now known
by the name of Hope-Distillery Pond, and lies a few hundred yards from
the Ohio, but is nearly surrounded with buildings of various kinds. <span class="smcap">Alexander
Wilson</span>, to whom I shewed the old nests of the Black Tern at
this place, did not seem to be acquainted with the bird, and thought that
they were those of some species of Rail.
</p>

<p>
The nest is usually placed on the top of a broken tussock of the rankest
grasses, of which it is itself composed, it being of a flattish form, and
about two inches thick. It is enlarged or renewed every year, some nests
being found to be from four to six inches in height. In some instances
the water surrounds the foot of the tussock on which it is placed. They
begin to lay on the first days of June. The eggs, of which the full number
is four, greatly resemble in colour those of the Sandwich and Arctic
Terns. When disturbed at this season, these birds are as noisy as any of
the tribe; but they remain close over the place, and go to the river only
at intervals to procure food. Both sexes incubate by turns, and the eggs
are kept constantly covered. They average in length one inch and three-eighths
by one inch across, and are nearly of an elliptical form, being but
slightly pointed at one end; their ground colour is greenish-buff, spotted
and dashed with reddish umber and black, more abundantly toward the
middle. I took the trouble of counting the number of nests round the
pond, and found it more than seventy. About the middle of August the
young fly well, and are able to seek food for themselves. I have seen the
parent birds feed them on wing in the manner of swallows.
</p>

<p>
They alight less frequently on the water than the larger species. On
shore they walk like swallows. During autumn they hunt for food over
the wet prairies, passing low, and picking up the insects as they proceed
without alighting. At this season, both old and young have become more
silent. They are at all times less shy than most others of the tribe. Their
principal food consists of aquatic insects and small fry, and their flesh is
tolerably good.
</p>

<p>
Since I wrote the above notice, I have been informed by my youngest
son that this species was still seen about the Falls of the Ohio, in considerable
numbers, a few years ago; but that, although he observed them
there in spring, summer, and early autumn, he did not discover their
breeding grounds, which are perhaps now farther inland than formerly.

<h2>
NATCHEZ IN 1820.
</h2>

<p>
One clear frosty morning in December I approached in my flat-boat
the City of Natchez. The shores were crowded with boats of various
kinds, laden with the produce of the western country; and there was a
bustle about them, such as you might see at a general fair, each person
being intent on securing the advantage of a good market. Yet the scene
was far from being altogether pleasing, for I was yet “under the hill;”
but on removing from the lower town, I beheld the cliffs on which the
city, properly so called, has been built. Vultures unnumbered flew close
along the ground on expanded pinions, searching for food; large pines
and superb magnolias here and there raised their evergreen tops toward
the skies; while on the opposite shores of the Mississippi, vast alluvial
beds stretched along, and the view terminated with the dense forest.
Steamers moved rapidly on the broad waters of the great stream; the
sunbeams fell with a peculiarly pleasant effect on the distant objects; and
as I watched the motions of the White-headed Eagle while pursuing the
Fishing Hawk, I thought of the wonderful ways of that Power to whom
I too owe my existence.
</p>

<p>
Before reaching the land I had observed that several saw-mills were
placed on ditches or narrow canals, along which the water rushed from
the inner swamps towards the river, and by which the timber is conveyed
to the shore; and on inquiring afterwards, I found that one of those temporary
establishments had produced a net profit of upwards of six thousand
dollars in a single season.
</p>

<p>
There is much romantic scenery about Natchez. The Lower Town
forms a most remarkable contrast with the Upper, for in the former the
houses were not regularly built, being generally dwellings formed of the
abandoned flat boats, placed in rows as if with the view of forming a long
street. The inhabitants formed a medley which it is beyond my power
to describe; hundreds of laden carts and other vehicles jogged along the
declivity between the two towns; but when, by a very rude causeway, I
gained the summit, I was relieved by the sight of an avenue of those
beautiful trees called here the Pride of China. In the Upper Town I
found the streets all laid off at right angles to each other, and tolerably
well lined with buildings, constructed with painted bricks or boards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_540' href='#Page_540'>540</a></span>
The agricultural richness of the surrounding country was shewn by the
heaps of cotton bales and other produce that encumbered the streets. The
churches, however, did not please me; but as if to make up for this, I
found myself unexpectedly accosted by my relative Mr <span class="smcap">Berthoud</span>, who
presented me with letters from my wife and sons. These circumstances put
me in high spirits, and we proceeded towards the best hotel in the place,
that of Mr <span class="smcap">Garnier</span>. The house, which was built on the Spanish plan,
and of great size, was surrounded by large virandas overlooking a fine
garden, and stood at a considerable distance from any other. At this
period the City of Natchez had a population not exceeding three thousand
individuals. I have not visited it often since, but I have no doubt that,
like all the other towns in the western district of our country, it has greatly
increased. It possessed a bank, and the mail arrived there thrice in
the week from all parts of the Union.
</p>

<p>
The first circumstance that strikes a stranger is the mildness of the
temperature. Several vegetables as pleasing to the eye as agreeable to
the palate, and which are seldom seen in our eastern markets before May,
were here already in perfection. The Pewee Fly-catcher had chosen the
neighbourhood of the city for its winter quarters, and our deservedly
famed Mocking Bird sang and danced gratis to every passer by. I was
surprised to see the immense number of Vultures that strode along the
streets, or slumbered on the roofs. The country for many miles inland
is gently undulated. Cotton is produced abundantly, and wealth and
happiness have taken up their abode under most of the planter’s roofs,
beneath which the wearied traveller or the poor wanderer in search of a
resting place, is sure to meet with comfort and relief. Game is abundant,
and the free Indians were wont in those days to furnish the markets with
ample supplies of venison and Wild Turkey. The Mississippi, which
bathes the foot of the hill, some hundred feet below the town, supplies
the inhabitants with fish of various kinds. The greatest deficiency is that
of water, which for common purposes is dragged on sledges or wheels from
the river, while that used for drinking is collected in tanks from the roofs,
and becomes very scarce during protracted droughts. Until of late years,
the orange-tree bore fruit in the open air; but owing to the great change
that has taken place in the temperature, severe though transient frosts occasionally
occur, which now prevent this plant from coming to perfection
in the open air.
</p>

<p>
The remains of an old Spanish Fort are still to be seen at a short distance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_541' href='#Page_541'>541</a></span>
from the city. If I am correctly informed, about two years previous
to this visit of mine, a large portion of the hill near it gave way, sank
about a hundred feet, and carried many of the houses of the lower town
into the river. This, it would appear, was occasioned by the quicksand
running springs that flow beneath the strata of mixed pebbles and clay,
of which the hill is composed. The part that has subsided presents the
appearance of a basin or bowl, and is used as a depot for the refuse of the
town, on which the Vultures feed when they can get nothing better.
There it was that I saw a White-headed Eagle chase one of those filthy
birds, knock it down, and feast on the entrails of a horse, which the Carrion
Crow had partly swallowed.
</p>

<p>
I did not meet at Natchez with many individuals fond of Ornithological
pursuits, but the hospitality with which I was received was such
as I am not likely to forget. Mr <span class="smcap">Garnier</span> subsequently proved an excellent
friend to me, as you may find elsewhere recorded. Of another individual,
whose kindness towards me is indelibly impressed on my heart,
I would say a few words, although he was such a man as <span class="smcap">Fenelon</span> alone
could describe. <span class="smcap">Charles Carré</span> was of French origin, the son of a
nobleman of the old regime. His acquirements and the benevolence of
his disposition were such, that when I first met with him, I could not help
looking upon him as another <span class="smcap">Mentor</span>. Although his few remaining
locks were grey, his countenance still expressed the gaiety and buoyant
feelings of youth. He had the best religious principles; for his heart and
his purse were ever open to the poor. Under his guidance it was that I
visited the whole neighbourhood of Natchez; for he was acquainted with
all its history, from the period at which it had first come under the power
of the Spaniards to that of their expulsion from the country, its possession
by the French, and subsequently by ourselves. He was also well
versed in the Indian languages, spoke French with the greatest purity, and
was a religious poet. Many a pleasant hour have I spent in his company;
but alas! he has gone the way of all the earth!

<h2>
THE GREAT WHITE HERON.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Ardea occidentalis.</i></span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXI.</span>
</p>

<p>
I am now about to present you with an account of the habits of the
largest species of the Heron tribe hitherto found in the United States,
and which is indeed remarkable not only for its great size, but also for
the pure white of its plumage at every period of its life. Writers who
have subdivided the family, and stated that none of the True Herons are
white, will doubtless be startled when they, for the first time, look at my
plate of this bird. I think, however, that our endeavours to discover the
natural arrangement of things cannot be uniformly successful, and it is
clear that he only who has studied <i>all</i> can have much chance of disposing
all according to their relations.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of April 1832, I landed on Indian Key in Florida, and
immediately after formed an acquaintance with Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span>, of whom I have
already several times spoken. He it was who first gave me notice of the
species which forms the subject of this article, and of which I cannot find
any description. The next day after that of my arrival, when I was
prevented from accompanying him by my anxiety to finish a drawing,
he came in with two young birds alive, and another lying dead in a
nest, which he had cut off from a mangrove. You may imagine how
delighted I was, when at the very first glance I felt assured that they
were different from any that I had previously seen. The two living birds
were of a beautiful white, slightly tinged with cream-colour, remarkably
fat and strong for their age, which the worthy Pilot said could
not be more than three weeks. The dead bird was quite putrid and
much smaller. It looked as if it had accidentally been trampled to
death by the parent birds ten or twelve days before, the body being
almost flat and covered with filth. The nest with the two live birds was
placed in the yard. The young Herons seemed quite unconcerned when
a person approached them, although on displaying one’s hand to them,
they at once endeavoured to strike it with their bill. My Newfoundland
dog, a well-trained and most sagacious animal, was whistled for and came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_543' href='#Page_543'>543</a></span>
up; on which the birds rose partially on their legs, ruffled all their feathers,
spread their wings, opened their bills, and clicked their mandibles in great
anger, but without attempting to leave the nest. I ordered the dog to go
near them, but not to hurt them. They waited until he went within
striking distance, when the largest suddenly hit him with its bill, and
hung to his nose. Plato, however, took it all in good part, and merely
brought the bird towards me, when I seized it by the wings, which made it
let go its hold. It walked off as proudly as any of its tribe, and I was
delighted to find it possessed of so much courage. These birds were left
under the charge of Mrs <span class="smcap">Egan</span>, until I returned from my various excursions
to the different islands along the coast.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of the same month, Mr <span class="smcap">Thruston</span> took me and my companions
in his beautiful barge to some keys on which the Florida Cormorants
were breeding in great numbers. As we were on the way we observed
two tall white Herons standing on their nests; but although I was
anxious to procure them alive, an unfortunate shot from one of the party
brought them to the water. They were, I was told, able to fly, but probably
had never seen a man before. While searching that day for nests
of the Zenaida Dove, we observed a young Heron of this species stalking
among the mangroves that bordered the key on which we were, and immediately
pursued it. Had you been looking on, good Reader, you might
have enjoyed a hearty laugh, although few of us could have joined you.
Seven or eight persons were engaged in the pursuit of this single bird,
which, with extended neck, wings, and legs, made off among the tangled
trees at such a rate, that, anxious as I was to obtain it alive, I several
times thought of shooting it. At length, however, it was caught, its bill
was securely tied, its legs were drawn up, and fastened by a strong cord,
and the poor thing was thus conveyed to Indian Key, and placed along with
its kinsfolk. On seeing it, the latter immediately ran towards it with open
bills, and greeted it with a most friendly welcome, passing their heads
over and under its own in the most curious and indeed ludicrous manner.
A bucketful of fish was thrown to them, which they swallowed in a few
minutes. After a few days, they also ate pieces of pork-rhind, cheese,
and other substances.
</p>

<p>
While sailing along the numerous islands that occur between Indian
Key and Key West, I saw many birds of this species, some in pairs, some
single, and others in flocks; but on no occasion did I succeed in getting
within shot of one. Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span> consoled me by saying that he knew some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_544' href='#Page_544'>544</a></span>
places beyond Key West where I certainly should obtain several, were
we to spend a day and a night there for the purpose. Dr <span class="smcap">Benjamin
Strobel</span> afterwards gave me a similar assurance. In the course of a week
after reaching Key West, I in fact procured more than a dozen birds of
different ages, as well as nests and eggs, and their habits were carefully
examined by several of my party.
</p>

<p>
At three o’clock one morning, you might have seen Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span> and
myself, about eight miles from our harbour, paddling as silently as possible
over some narrow and tortuous inlets, formed by the tides through a
large flat and partially submersed key. There we expected to find many
White Herons; but our labour was for a long time almost hopeless, for,
although other birds occurred, we had determined to shoot nothing but
the Great White Heron, and none of that species came near us. At length,
after six or seven hours of hard labour, a Heron flew right over our heads,
and to make sure of it, we both fired at once. The bird came down dead.
It proved to be a female, which had either been sitting on her eggs or
had lately hatched her young, her belly being bare, and her plumage
considerably worn. We now rested a while, and breakfasted on some biscuit
soaked in molasses and water, reposing under the shade of the mangroves,
where the mosquitoes had a good opportunity of breaking their
fast also. We went about from one key to another, saw a great number
of White Herons, and at length, towards night, reached the Marion,
rather exhausted, and having a solitary bird. Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span> and I had been
most of the time devising schemes for procuring others with less trouble,
a task which might easily have been accomplished a month before, when,
as he said, the birds were “sitting hard.” He asked if I would return
that night at twelve o’clock to the last key which we had visited. I mentioned
the proposal to our worthy Captain, who, ever willing to do all
in his power to oblige me, when the service did not require constant
attendance on board, said that if I would go, he would accompany us in
the gig. Our guns were soon cleaned, provisions and ammunition placed
in the boats, and after supping we talked and laughed until the appointed
time.

<p>
“Eight Bells” made us bound on our feet, and off we pushed for the
islands. The moon shone bright in the clear sky; but as the breeze had
died away, we betook ourselves to our oars. The state of the tide was
against us, and we had to drag our boats several miles over the soapy
shallows; but at last we found ourselves in a deep channel beneath the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_545' href='#Page_545'>545</a></span>
hanging mangroves of a large key, where we had observed the Herons
retiring to roost the previous evening. There we lay quietly until daybreak.
But the mosquitoes and sandflies! Reader, if you have not been
in such a place, you cannot easily conceive the torments we endured for a
whole hour, when it was absolutely necessary for us to remain perfectly
motionless. At length day dawned, and the boats parted, to meet on the
other side of the key. Slowly and silently each advanced. A Heron
sprung from its perch almost directly over our heads. Three barrels were
discharged,—in vain; the bird flew on unscathed; the pilot and I had
probably been too anxious. As the bird sped away, it croaked loudly,
and the noise, together with the report of our guns, roused some hundreds
of these Herons, which flew from the mangroves, and in the grey
light appeared to sail over and around us like so many spectres. I almost
despaired of procuring any more. The tide was now rising, and when we
met with the other boat we were told, that if we had waited until we
could have shot at them while perched, we might have killed several; but
that now we must remain until full tide, for the birds had gone to their
feeding grounds.
</p>

<p>
The boats parted again, and it was now arranged that whenever a
Heron was killed, another shot should be fired exactly one minute after, by
which each party would be made aware of the success of the other. Mr
<span class="smcap">Egan</span>, pointing to a nest on which stood two small young birds, desired
to be landed near it. I proceeded into a narrow bayou, where we remained
quiet for about half an hour, when a Heron flew over us and was
shot. It was a very fine old male. Before firing my signal shot, I heard
a report from afar, and a little after mine was discharged I heard another
shot, so I felt assured that two birds had been killed. When I reached
the Captain’s boat I found that he had in fact obtained two; but Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span>
had waited two hours in vain near the nest, for none of the old birds came
up. We took him from his hiding place, and brought the Herons along
with us. It was now nearly high water. About a mile from us, more
than a hundred Herons stood on a mud-bar up to their bellies. The pilot
said that now was our best chance, as the tide would soon force them to
fly, when they would come to rest on the trees. So we divided, each
choosing his own place, and I went to the lowest end of the key, where it
was separated from another by a channel. I soon had the pleasure of observing
all the Herons take to wing, one after another, in quick succession.
I then heard my companions’ guns, but no signal of success. Obtaining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_546' href='#Page_546'>546</a></span>
a good chance as I thought, I fired at a remarkably large bird,
and distinctly heard the shot strike it. The Heron merely croaked, and
pursued its course. Not another bird came near enough to be shot at,
although many had alighted on the neighbouring key, and stood perched
like so many newly finished statues of the purest alabaster, forming a fine
contrast to the deep blue sky. The boats joined us. Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span> had one
bird, the Captain another, and both looked at me with surprise. We
now started for the next key, where we expected to see more. When we
had advanced several hundred yards along its low banks, we found the
bird at which I had shot lying with extended wings in the agonies of
death. It was from this specimen that the drawing was made. I was
satisfied with the fruits of this day’s excursion. On other occasions I
procured fifteen more birds, and judging that number sufficient, I left the
Herons to their occupations.
</p>

<p>
This species is extremely shy. Sometimes they would rise when at the
distance of half a mile from us, and fly quite out of sight. If pursued,
they would return to the very keys or mud-flats from which they had
risen, and it was almost impossible to approach one while perched or
standing in the water. Indeed, I have no doubt that half a dozen specimens
of <i>Ardea Herodias</i> could be procured for one of the present, in the
same time and under similar circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The Great White Heron is a constant resident on the Florida Keys,
where it is found more abundant during the breeding season than anywhere
else. They rarely go as far eastward as Cape Florida, and are not
seen on the Tortugas, probably because these islands are destitute of mangroves.
They begin to pair early in March, but many do not lay their
eggs until the middle of April. Their courtships were represented to me
as similar to those of the Great Blue Heron. Their nests are at times
met with at considerable distances from each other, and although many
are found on the same keys, they are placed farther apart than those of
the species just mentioned. They are seldom more than a few feet above
high water-mark, which in the Floridas is so low, that they look as if only
a yard or two above the roots of the trees. From twenty to thirty nests
which I examined were thus placed. They were large, about three feet
in diameter, formed of sticks of different sizes, but without any appearance
of lining, and quite flat, being several inches thick. The eggs are
always three, measure two inches and three quarters in length, one inch
and eight-twelfths in breadth, and have a rather thick shell, of a uniform
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_547' href='#Page_547'>547</a></span>
plain light bluish-green colour. Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span> told me that incubation continues
about thirty days, that both birds sit, (the female, however, being
most assiduous,) and with their legs stretched out before them, in the
same manner as the young when two or three weeks old. The latter, of
which I saw several from ten days to a month old, were pure white, slightly
tinged with cream colour, and had no indications of a crest. Those which
I carried to Charleston, and which were kept for more than a year, exhibited
nothing of the kind. I am unable to say how long it is before
they attain their full plumage as represented in the plate, when, as you
see, the head is broadly but loosely and shortly tufted, the feathers of the
breast pendent, but not remarkably long, and there are none of the narrow
feathers seen in other species over the rump or wings.
</p>

<p>
These Herons are sedate, quiet, and perhaps even less animated than
the <i>A. Herodias</i>. They walk majestically, with firmness and great elegance.
Unlike the species just named, they <i>flock</i> at their feeding grounds,
sometimes a hundred or more being seen together; and what is still more
remarkable is, that they betake themselves to the mud-flats or sand-bars
at a distance from the Keys on which they roost and breed. They seem,
in so far as I could judge, to be diurnal, an opinion corroborated by the
testimony of Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span>, a person of great judgment, sagacity and integrity.
While on these banks, they stand motionless, rarely moving towards
their prey, but waiting until it comes near, when they strike it and
swallow it alive, or when large beat it on the water, or shake it violently,
biting it severely all the while. They never leave their feeding grounds
until driven off by the tide, remaining until the water reaches their body.
So wary are they, that although they may return to roost on the same
keys, they rarely alight on trees to which they have resorted before, and
if repeatedly disturbed they do not return, for many weeks at least.
When roosting, they generally stand on one foot, the other being drawn
up, and, unlike the Ibises, are never seen lying flat on trees, where, however,
they draw in their long neck, and place their head under their
wing.
</p>

<p>
I was often surprised to see that while a flock was resting by day in
the position just described, one or more stood with outstretched necks,
keenly eyeing all around, now and then suddenly starting at the sight of
a Porpoise or Shark in chase of some fish. The appearance of a man or
a boat, seemed to distract them; and yet I was told that nobody ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_548' href='#Page_548'>548</a></span>
goes in pursuit of them. If surprised, they leave their perch with a rough
croaking sound, and fly directly to a great distance, but never inland.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Great White Heron is firm, regular, and greatly
protracted. They propel themselves by regular slow flaps, the head being
drawn in after they have proceeded a few yards, and their legs extended
behind, as is the case with all other Herons. They also now and then rise
high in the air, where they sail in wide circles, and they never alight without
performing this circling flight, unless when going to feeding grounds
on which other individuals have already settled. It is truly surprising that
a bird of so powerful a flight never visits Georgia or the Carolinas, nor goes
to the Mainland. When you see them about the middle of the day on their
feeding grounds they “loom” to about double their size, and present a
singular appearance. It is difficult to kill them unless with buck-shot,
which we found ourselves obliged to use.
</p>

<p>
When I left Key West, on our return towards Charleston, I took
with me two young birds that had been consigned to the care of my
friend Dr <span class="smcap">B. Strobel</span>, who assured me that they devoured more than
their weight of food per day. I had also two young birds of the <i>Ardea
Herodias</i> alive. After bringing them on board, I placed them all together
in a very large coop; but was soon obliged to separate the two species,
for the white birds would not be reconciled to the blue, which they would
have killed. While the former had the privilege of the deck for a few
minutes, they struck at the smaller species, such as the young of <i>Ardea
rufescens</i> and <i>A. Ludoviciana</i>, some of which they instantly killed and
swallowed entire, although they were abundantly fed on the flesh of green
Turtles. None of the sailors succeeded in making friends with them.
</p>

<p>
On reaching Indian Key, I found those which had been left with Mrs
<span class="smcap">Egan</span>, in excellent health and much increased in size, but to my surprise
observed that their bills were much broken, which she assured me had
been caused by the great force with which they struck at the fishes
thrown to them on the rocks of their enclosure,—a statement which I
found confirmed by my own observation in the course of the day. It was
almost as difficult to catch them in the yard, as if they had never seen a
man before, and we were obliged to tie their bills fast, to avoid being
wounded by them while carrying them on board. They thrived well, and
never manifested the least animosity towards each other. One of them
which accidentally walked before the coop in which the Blue Herons were,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_549' href='#Page_549'>549</a></span>
thrust its bill between the bars, and transfixed the head of one of these
birds, so that it was instantaneously killed.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived at Charleston, four of them were still alive. They
were taken to my friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>, who was glad to see them. He
kept a pair, and offered the other to our mutual friend Dr <span class="smcap">Samuel Wilson</span>,
who accepted them, but soon afterwards gave them to Dr <span class="smcap">Gibbes</span>
of Columbia College, merely because they had killed a number of Ducks.
My friend <span class="smcap">Bachman</span> kept two of these birds for many months; but it
was difficult for him to procure fish enough for them, as they swallowed
a bucketful of mullets in a few minutes, each devouring about a gallon
of these fishes. They betook themselves to roosting in a beautiful arbour
in his garden; where at night they looked with their pure white plumage
like beings of another world. It is a curious fact, that the points of their
bills, of which an inch at least had been broken, grew again, and were as
regularly shaped at the end of six months as if nothing had happened to
them. In the evening or early in the morning, they would frequently
set, like pointer dogs, at moths which hovered over the flowers, and with
a well-directed stroke of their bill seize the fluttering insect and instantly
swallow it. On many occasions, they also struck at chickens, grown
fowls and ducks, which they would tear up and devour. Once a cat
which was asleep in the sunshine, on the wooden steps of the viranda, was
pinned through the body to the boards, and killed by one of them. At
last they began to pursue the younger children of my worthy friend, who
therefore ordered them to be killed. One of them was beautifully mounted
by my assistant Mr <span class="smcap">Henry Ward</span>, and is now in the Museum of Charleston.
Dr <span class="smcap">Gibbes</span> was obliged to treat his in the same manner; and I afterwards
saw one of them in his collection. Of the fifteen skins of this species
which I carried to Philadelphia, one was presented to the Academy of
Natural Sciences of that beautiful city, another was given in exchange
for various skins, and two I believe are now in the possession of <span class="smcap">George
Cooper</span>, Esq. of New York. Two were sent along with other specimens
to Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span> of Twizel House, Northumberland. On my arrival in
England, I presented a pair to His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex,
who gave them to the British Museum, where I have since seen them
mounted. I also presented a specimen to the Zoological Society of London.
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Egan</span> kept for about a year one of these birds, which he raised
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_550' href='#Page_550'>550</a></span>
from the nest, and which, when well grown, was allowed to ramble along
the shores of Indian Key in quest of food. One of the wings had been
cut, and the bird was known to all the resident inhabitants, but was at
last shot by some Indian Hunter, who had gone there to dispose of a collection
of sea shells.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Herons feed on the berries of certain trees during the
latter part of autumn and the beginning of winter. Dr <span class="smcap">B. B. Strobel</span>
observed the Night Heron eating those of the “Gobolimbo,” late in September
at Key West.
</p>

<p>
Among the varied and contradictory descriptions of Herons, you will
find it alleged that these birds seize fish while on wing by plunging the
head and neck into the water; but this seems to me extremely doubtful.
Nor, I believe, do they watch for their prey while perched on trees. Another
opinion is, that Herons are always thin, and unfit for food. This,
however, is by no means generally the case in America, and I have
thought these birds very good eating when not too old.

THE WHITE-WINGED SILVERY GULL.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Larus leucopterus</i>, Faber.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXII. Adult Male, and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
I have not met with this species farther south than the Bay of New
York. During the winter it is not rare about Boston and farther eastward.
At the approach of summer, before the pairing of the Herring
Gull, <i>Larus argentatus</i>, the White-winged Gulls collect in flocks, and set
out for the distant north, where they breed.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this species so much resembles that of the Herring Gull,
that were it not for its smaller size, and the different colour of its wings,
it could not be distinguished from the other. It is less shy, however,
proceeds farther up the rivers and salt-water creeks, and alights oftener
on the water as well as on the salt-meadows, than that species. While at
Portland in Maine, I observed a good number of these Gulls flying over
the inner harbour close to the shores, descending towards the water, and
picking up garbage in the manner of the Herring Gulls, with which they
associated. Their notes were not so loud, nor so often heard.
</p>

<p>
I was surprised to find but very few on the coast of Labrador, and
these did not seem to be breeding, for although we carefully watched them,
we did not succeed in finding any nests.

<h2>
THE WANDERING SHEARWATER.

<span class="smcap"><i>Puffinus cinereus</i>, Cuv.</span>

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXIII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
I have found this species ranging from the Gulf of St Lawrence to
that of Mexico, but have very seldom seen it near the coast. While sailing
round Nova Scotia, on my way to Labrador, early in June, I observed
one evening about sunset, a great number flying from the rocky
shores, which induced me to think that they bred there. Scarcely one
was to be seen during the day, and this circumstance strengthened my
opinion, as I was aware that these birds are in the habit of remaining
about their nests at that time. In September the case is very different;
for they are then seen far out at sea, at all hours by day and through the
night.
</p>

<p>
In calm weather, they are fond of alighting on the water, in company
with the Fulmars, and are then easily approached. They swim buoyantly,
and have a graceful appearance while playing among themselves.
Two that had been caught with hooks, walked as well as Ducks, and
made no pretence of sitting on their rumps, as some writers have said
they do. On being approached, they opened their bills, raised their feathers,
and squirted an oily substance through their nostrils, which they
continued to do when held in the hand, at the same time scratching with
their sharp claws and bills. They refused all sorts of food; and as they
were unpleasant pets, they were set at liberty. To my great surprise,
instead of flying directly off, as I expected, they launched toward the
water, dived several yards obliquely, and on coming to the surface, splashed
and washed themselves for several minutes before they took to wing, when
they flew away with their usual ease and grace.
</p>

<p>
The flight of this wanderer of the ocean is extremely rapid and protracted.
When it blows hard, it skims along the troughs of the waves
on extended wings in large curves, shewing its upper and lower parts alternately,
evidently with the view of being aided by the wind. In calm
weather its flight is much lower and less rapid, and it rarely throws its
body sideways, but seems to feed more abundantly than during boisterous
weather. Like the small Petrels, it frequently uses its feet to support
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_556' href='#Page_556'>556</a></span>
itself on the surface, without actually alighting. In the stomach of
those which I opened, I found fishes, portions of crabs, sea-weeds, and
oily substances. It does not appear that this species goes far north, as
was formerly supposed; for none of the late northern voyagers mention
having seen it, although they found the Fulmar abundant.

THE PURPLE SANDPIPER.

<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXIV. Adult in summer and in winter.</span>
</p>

<p>
I am surprised that my worthy friend <span class="smcap">Thomas Nuttall</span> speaks of
this species as being scarcely ever seen in the United States, where, to my
knowledge, it is on the contrary very abundant, and nowhere more so
than in the neighbourhood of the Harbour of Boston, in the markets of
which city it is sold in autumn and winter. When I was there, a gunner
whom I employed brought me several dozens, which he had killed
in the course of a single afternoon. I have also seen some in the markets
of New York. Farther south, however, they are rarely met with.
</p>

<p>
Timid though not shy, they are seen in flocks of eight or ten, on the
rocky shores of the sea. They seem to shun sandy beaches, and seldom
advance far inland. While I was on the Bay of Fundy, I observed numerous
small flocks winging their way northward, in the month of May.
On one occasion, a flock alighted almost at my feet, so that I was obliged
to retire to a proper distance before shooting at them.
</p>

<p>
Their flight is pretty rapid, and when necessary sustained, for I have
observed them flying in compact bodies across the Gulf of St Lawrence.
When started along the shores, they emit a feeble <i>weet</i>, which is repeated
two or three times, take a sweep over the water, and return to the same
spot or near it, somewhat in the manner of the Spotted Sandpiper. They
are generally very busy while searching for food, run nimbly with the
body lowered on the legs, which are much bent, go to the edge of the
water, seize on small shell-fish, shrimps and worms, and search industriously
among the sea-weeds for marine insects. Their marked predilection
for rocky shores has caused them to be named “Rock Snipes” by the
gunners of our eastern coast. In autumn and winter the young birds
become fat, and afford delicate eating.
</p>

<p>
I was sadly disappointed at not finding them breeding on any part
of the coast of Labrador which I visited, the more so because Dr
<span class="smcap">Richardson</span> says they are abundant on the shores of Hudson’s Bay,
where they breed. He gives no description of the nest or localities on
which they deposit their eggs, which are said to be “pyriform,
<span class="mixfract">16&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> lines
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_559' href='#Page_559'>559</a></span>
long, and an inch across at their greatest breadth. Their colour is yellowish-grey,
interspersed with small irregular spots of pale brown, crowded
at the obtuse end, and rare at the other.”

<h2>
THE FORKED-TAILED GULL.
</h2>

<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXV. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
On my return from Labrador, I had the pleasure of seeing this interesting
little Gull flying over the harbour of Halifax in Nova Scotia. It was
in company with our Common American Gull. Although I have not observed
it on our eastern shores or farther south on the coast, it is not improbable
that it rambles there in winter along with other species which, like
itself, breed far north. Its flight in some measure resembles that of the
Common Tern, although it is more decided, and, consequently, more like
that of the smaller species of its own genus. In the course of a voyage from
Pictou in Nova Scotia to Hull in England, lately performed by my friend
Mr <span class="smcap">Thomas MacCulloch</span>, he saw great numbers of this species when
more than a hundred miles off Newfoundland. They flew around the ship
in company with an almost equal number of Ross’s Gull.
</p>

<p>
Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> gives the following account of the Forked-tailed Gull,
in the Fauna Boreali-Americana. “This interesting species of Gull was
discovered by Captain <span class="smcap">Edward Sabine</span>. It was first seen on the 25th
of July at its breeding station on some low rocky islands lying off the
west coast of Greenland, associated in considerable numbers with the
Arctic Tern, the nests of both birds being intermingled. It is analogous
to the Tern not only in its forked tail, and in its choice of a breeding
place, but also in the boldness which it displays in the protection of its
young. The parent birds flew with impetuosity towards persons approaching
their nests, and when one was killed, its mate, though frequently fired
at, continued on the wing close to the spot. They were observed to get
their food on the sea-beach, standing near the water’s edge, and picking
up the marine insects which were cast on shore. A solitary individual
was seen in Prince Regent’s Inlet, on Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Parry</span>’s first voyage,
and many specimens were procured in the course of the second voyage on
Melville Peninsula. Captain <span class="smcap">Sabine</span> also killed a pair at Spitzbergen,
so that it is a pretty general summer visitor to the Arctic Seas, and is entitled
to be enumerated amongst the European as well as the American
birds. It arrives in the high northern latitudes in June, and retires to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_562' href='#Page_562'>562</a></span>
the southward in August. Specimens procured in June and July corresponded
exactly with the one described below. When newly killed, they
all had a delicate pink blush on their under plumage. The eggs, two in
number, are deposited on the bare ground, and are hatched in the last
week of July. They are an inch and a half in length, and have an olive
colour with many brown blotches.”
</p>

<p>
At the approach of autumn, it frequently happens that several species
of gulls associate together, and at times congregate in great numbers on
the outer margins of sand-bars and in the large estuaries. There they
keep up a constant cackling, run about, dress their plumage, and await
the rising of the waters. If disturbed at such times, they shew greater
shyness than perhaps at any other. One of the oldest birds sounds an
alarm, and all simultaneously take to wing, disperse, and gradually rise
to a great elevation, flying in wide circles, and moving seaward. I have
thought it remarkable that these birds seldom shun the fishermen, while
towards any one bearing the semblance of a gunner they act with extreme
caution. Although loquacious when congregated, they are when separated
quite silent, especially when on wing. In squally and rainy weather they
skim low over the water or the land, always against the wind. They are
very tenacious of life, and often, when wounded, revive after you had considered
them incapable of breathing. The instant they are caught they are
wont to mute and eject the contents of their stomach, as well as when suddenly
compelled to take to wing, or when pursued by predaceous birds.
In particular states of the weather they appear at a distance much larger
than they really are, and, on such occasions, they also seem much nearer,
so that the gunner is greatly deceived, and may shoot at them when too
far off.

<h2>
THE LOST PORTFOLIO.
</h2>

<p>
While I was at Natchez, on the 31st of December 1820, my kind
friend <span class="smcap">Nicholas Berthoud</span>, Esq. proposed to me to accompany him in
his keel-boat to New Orleans. At one o’clock, the steam-boat Columbus
hauled off from the landing, and took our bark in tow. The steamer was
soon ploughing along at full speed, and little else engaged our minds than
the thought of our soon arriving at the emporium of the commerce of the
Mississippi. Towards evening, however, several inquiries were made respecting
particular portions of the luggage, among which ought to have
been one of my portfolios containing a number of drawings made by me
while gliding down the Ohio and Mississippi from Cincinnati to Natchez,
and of which some were to me peculiarly valuable, being of birds previously
unfigured, and perhaps undescribed. The portfolio was nowhere
to be found, and I recollected that I had brought it under my arm to the
margin of the stream, and there left it to the care of one of my friend’s
servants, who, in the hurry of our departure, had neglected to take it on
board. Besides the drawings of birds, there was in this collection a sketch
in black chalk, to which I always felt greatly attached while from home.
It is true the features which it represented were indelibly engraved in my
heart; but the portrait of her to whom I owe so much of the happiness
that I have enjoyed was not the less dear to me. When I thought during
the following night of the loss I had sustained in consequence of my
own negligence, imagined the possible fate of the collection, and saw it in
the hands of one of the numerous boatmen lounging along the shores,
who might paste the drawings to the walls of his cabin, nail them to the
steering-oars of his flat-boat, or distribute them among his fellows, I felt
little less vexed than I did some years before when the rats, as you know,
devoured a much larger collection.
</p>

<p>
It was useless to fret myself, and so I began to devise a scheme for
recovering the drawings. I wrote to Mr <span class="smcap">Garnier</span> and my venerable
friend <span class="smcap">Charles Carré</span>. Mr <span class="smcap">Berthoud</span> also wrote to a mercantile acquaintance.
The letters were forwarded to Natchez from the first landing
place at which we stopped, and in the course of time we reached the
great eddy running by the Levee or artificial embankment at New Orleans.
But before I present you with the answers to the letters sent to our acquaintances
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_565' href='#Page_565'>565</a></span>
at Natchez, allow me to offer a statement of our adventures
on the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
After leaving the eddy at Natchez, we passed a long file of exquisitely
beautiful Bluffs. At the end of twenty hours we reached Bayou Sara,
where we found two brigs at anchor, several steamers, and a number of
flat-boats, the place being of considerable mercantile importance. Here
the Columbus left us to shift for ourselves, her commander being anxious
to get to Baton Rouge by a certain hour, in order to secure a good cargo
of cotton. We now proceeded along the great stream, sometimes floating
and sometimes rowing. The shores gradually became lower and
flatter, orange-trees began to make their appearance around the dwellings
of the wealthy planters, and the verdure along the banks assumed
a brighter tint. The thermometer stood at 68° in the shade at noon;
butterflies fluttered among the flowers, of which many were in full blow;
and we expected to have seen alligators half-awake floating on the numberless
logs that accompanied us in our slow progress. The eddies were
covered with ducks of various kinds, more especially with the beautiful
species that breeds by preference on the great sycamores that every now
and then present themselves along our southern waters. Baton Rouge is a
very handsome place, but at present I have not time to describe it. Levees
now began to stretch along the river, and wherever there was a sharp point
on the shore, negroes were there amusing themselves by raising shrimps,
and now and then a cat-fish, with scooping-nets.
</p>

<p>
The river increased in breadth and depth, and the sawyers and planters,
logs so called, diminished in number the nearer we drew towards the
famed city. At every bend we found the plantations increased, and now
the whole country on both sides became so level and destitute of trees
along the water’s edge, that we could see over the points before us, and
observe the great stream stretching along for miles. Within the levees
the land is much lower than the surface of the river when the water is
high; but at this time we could see over the levee from the deck of our
boat only the upper windows of the planters’ houses, or the tops of the trees
about them, and the melancholy looking cypresses covered with Spanish
moss forming the back ground. Persons rode along the levees at full speed;
pelicans, gulls, vultures, and carrion crows sailed over the stream, and at
times there came from the shore a breeze laden with the delicious perfume
of the orange-trees, which were covered with blossoms and golden fruits.
</p>

<p>
Having passed Bayou Lafourche, our boat was brought-to on account
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_566' href='#Page_566'>566</a></span>
of the wind, which blew with violence. We landed, and presently made
our way to the swamps, where we shot a number of those beautiful birds
called Boat-tailed Grakles. The mocking birds on the fence-stakes saluted
us with so much courtesy and with such delightful strains, that we
could not think of injuring them; but we thought it no harm to shoot a
whole covey of partridges. In the swamps we met with warblers of various
kinds, lively and beautiful, waiting in these their winter retreats for
the moment when Boreas should retire to his icy home, and the gentle
gales of the south should waft them toward their breeding places in the
north. Thousands of swallows flew about us, the cat-birds mewed in
answer to their chatterings, the cardinal grosbeak elevated his glowing
crest as he stood perched on the magnolia branch, the soft notes of the
doves echoed among the woods, nature smiled upon us, and we were
happy.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth of January we stopped at Bonnet Carré, where I entered
a house to ask some questions about birds. I was received by a
venerable French gentleman, whom I found in charge of about a dozen
children of both sexes, and who was delighted to hear that I was a student
of nature. He was well acquainted with my old friend <span class="smcap">Charles
Carré</span>, and must, I thought, be a good man, for he said he never suffered
any of his pupils to rob a bird of her eggs or young, although, said he
with a smile, “they are welcome to peep at them and love them.” The
boys at once surrounded me, and from them I received satisfactory answers
to most of my queries respecting birds.
</p>

<p>
The sixth of January was so cold that the thermometer fell to 30°,
and we had seen ice on the running boards of our keel boat. This was
quite unlooked for, and we felt uncomfortable; but before the middle of
the day, all nature was again in full play. Several beautiful steamers
passed us. The vegetation seemed not to have suffered from the frost;
green pease, artichokes and other vegetables were in prime condition.
This reminds me that on one of my late journeys, I ate green pease in
December in the Floridas, and had them once a-week at least in my course
over the whole of the Union, until I found myself and my family feeding
on the same vegetable more than a hundred miles to the North of the St
John’s River in New Brunswick.
</p>

<p>
Early on the seventh, thousands of tall spars, called masts by the
mariners, came in sight; and as we drew nearer, we saw the port filled
with ships of many nations, each bearing the flag of its country. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_567' href='#Page_567'>567</a></span>
length we reached the Levee, and found ourselves once more at New
Orleans. In a short time my companions dispersed, and I commenced a
search for something that might tend to compensate me for the loss of my
drawings.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of March following, I had the gratification of receiving a
letter from Mr <span class="smcap">A. P. Bodley</span>, of Natchez, informing me that my portfolio
had been found and deposited at the office of “the Mississippi Republican,”
whence an order from me would liberate it. Through the
kindness of Mr <span class="smcap">Garnier</span>, I received it on the 5th of April. So very generous
had been the finder of it, that when I carefully examined the
drawings in succession, I found them all present and uninjured, save one,
which had probably been kept by way of commission.

<h2>
THE WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Anser albifrons</i>, Bechst.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXVI. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
Neither <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> nor <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> seem to have been aware of the
regularity with which this species migrates through the United States.
When I shewed a drawing of it to the first of these authors, he pronounced
it to be a young Snow Goose, although I described to him its peculiar
notes. During the whole of my residence in Kentucky, a winter never
passed without my seeing a good number of them; and at that season
they are frequently offered for sale in the markets of New Orleans. An
English gentleman, who was on his way to the settlement of Birkbeck in
the Prairies west of the Ohio, and who spent a few weeks with me at
Henderson, was desirous of having a tasting of some of our game. His
desire was fully gratified, and the first that was placed before him was a
White-fronted Goose. I had killed seven of these birds, the evening
before, in a pond across the Ohio, which was regularly supplied with
flocks from the beginning of October to the end of March. He pronounced
it “delicious,” and I have no reason to dissent from his opinion.
From the numbers seen high on the Arkansas River, I presume that
many winter beyond the southern limits of the United States. They are
exceedingly rare, however, along our Atlantic coast. In Kentucky they
generally arrive before the Canada Goose, betaking themselves to the
grassy ponds; and of the different species which visit that country they
are by far the least shy. The flocks seldom exceed from thirty to fifty
individuals. Their general appearance is that exhibited in the plate, and
which I consider as their winter plumage, feeling pretty confident that
in summer the lower part of the body becomes pure black.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the White-fronted is very similar to that of the Canada
Goose, being firm and well sustained. When travelling, these birds pass
at a considerable height, arranged in the same angular order, and apparently
guided by one of the older Ganders. They walk with ease, and
can run with considerable speed when wounded. In feeding they immerse
their necks, like other species; but during continued rains they
visit the cornfields and large savannahs. While in Kentucky they feed
on the beech nuts and acorns that drop along the margins of their favourite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_569' href='#Page_569'>569</a></span>
ponds. In the fields they pick up the grains of maize left by the
squirrels and racoons, and nibble the young blades of grass. In their
gizzards I have never found fishes or water lizards, but often broken
shells of different kinds of snails.
</p>

<p>
They leave us a fortnight sooner than the Canada Geese, and start
along with the Snow Geese, but keep in separate flocks. In this order
they have been observed travelling over the fur countries by Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>,
who informs us that they breed in the woody districts skirting Mackenzie’s
River to the north of the sixty-seventh parallel, and also on the
islands of the Arctic Sea; but that they are not common about Hudson’s
Bay. The egg of this Goose measures two inches and three-quarters in
length, by one and three-quarters in breadth. The shell is smooth, of a
dull yellowish-green, with indistinct patches of a darker tint of the same
colour.

Having ascertained that this beautiful species visits the southern coast
of Labrador and Newfoundland every winter, I have thought it probable
that it occasionally extends its rambles as far as our eastern shores, and
therefore determined to include it in my Illustrations. The figures in the
plate were taken from two specimens procured by Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark
Ross</span>, one of which was an adult male, the other a young bird in its second
year. Captain <span class="smcap">Sabine</span> says that the Ivory Gulls are attracted in
considerable numbers by whale blubber, are therefore usually found in
company with the <i>Procellaria glacialis</i>, and are easily killed, being by
no means shy. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> informs us that they were observed
breeding in great numbers on the high perforated cliffs which form the
extremity of Cape Parry, in latitude 70°.

<h2>
THE YELLOWSHANK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Totanus flavipes</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXVIII. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Yellowshank is much more abundant in the interior, or to the
westward of the Alleghany Mountains than along our Atlantic coast, although
it is also met with in the whole extent of the latter, from Florida
to Maine. It exceeds the Tell-tale Godwit in numbers on the shores of
the Ohio, as well as on the margins of the numerous ponds and lakes in
the vicinity of the Mississippi, from the mouth of the river just mentioned
to New Orleans, and beyond that city southward. In early autumn, when
the sand-bars of the Ohio are left uncovered, these active birds are seen
upon them in small flocks, formed each apparently of a single family,
busily employed in searching for food, and wading in the water up to the
feathered part of their legs. When the water is high, they resort to
ponds and damp meadows intersected by small rivulets. In the Carolinas
and the Floridas they are pretty numerous, in the former betaking themselves
to the rice-fields, and in the latter to the wet savannahs. They
are equally fond of frequenting the shores of our estuaries that are bordered
by salt marshes, on the muddy edges of which they find their food. I
have also met with them on the margins of clear streams in the interior
of the States, and indeed should hardly be able to mention a district in
which the species is not to be seen, from the beginning of September until
May, when the greater number retire northward, although some remain
and breed, even in our Middle States, as <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> says they are
seen in the neighbourhood of Boston in the middle of June. I found a
few on the coast of Labrador, but did not succeed in discovering their
nests, which was the more surprising that these birds, according to my
friend <span class="smcap">Thomas MacCulloch</span>, breed in considerable numbers about
Pictou. He describes the nest as placed among the grass on the edges
of the rivers and large ponds of the interior.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Yellowshank is very similar to that of the Tell-tale
Godwit. They generally run to some distance before they take to wing,
stop as if to discover your intention, vibrate their body backwards and
forwards, intimate by their cries the knowledge they have of the nature of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_574' href='#Page_574'>574</a></span>
the weapon you carry, and, as if convinced that you are bent on mischief,
spring up, rise obliquely to some height, emit louder notes, and with
continued flappings pass around you, or remove to some distant place.
Their long yellow legs, which are stretched out behind, are quite conspicuous
when they are on wing. Should you bring one to the ground
wounded, it walks off leisurely, vibrates its body, and emits plaintive
cries; and should one fall into the water under similar circumstances, it
paddles its way towards the nearest shore with considerable speed. If you
approach it, it may immerse its head, but it cannot dive to any depth.
</p>

<p>
In very dry weather, I have observed this species on the uplands
searching for grasshoppers and insects. It has been alleged that when
one is wounded, its companions hover around so as to be easily shot; but
this I have never observed, for although they are perhaps less shy than
the Tell-tales, on such occasions, I never found one of them to remain;
they seemed, on the contrary, to be well aware of the danger, and would
fly quite out of sight, rising high in the air, and pursuing a direct course,
emitting cries at intervals.
</p>

<p>
Along the shores of the sea, they are now and then seen in company
with other species, although they cannot be said actually to associate with
them. In autumn they become fat, and by many are considered good eating,
although they always have a kind of fishy taste not at all agreeable
to my palate. Their food consists of diminutive fishes, shrimps, worms,
and aquatic insects.
</p>

<p>
I have represented one of these birds on the fore ground of a little
piece of water a few miles distant from Charleston in South Carolina, on
the borders of which, in the company of my kind friend <span class="smcap">John Bachman</span>
and others, I have spent many a pleasant hour, while resting after fatiguing
rambles in the surrounding woods.

<h2>
SOLITARY SANDPIPER.

<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Totanus chloropygius</i>, Vieill.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCLXXXIX. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
The only nest of this bird that I ever met with was placed in an elevated
part of the woods near Bayou Sara, on the margin of a small pond
scarcely ten yards broad, overgrown with low bushes, and cumbered with
fallen branches of trees. It was formed of grass and withered leaves, arranged
without much care, and contained three eggs. Both birds were greatly
disconcerted, ran round me, and frequently alighted on the twigs and
branches with all the nimbleness of land birds, constantly throwing their
heads forward and vibrating their body and tail in the manner of the Louisiana
Water Thrush. The eggs measured one inch one eighth and a half in
length, seven and a half eighths in breadth; the colour was greenish-yellow,
with spots and patches of umber, more abundant around the crown,
where the larger marks formed a conspicuous circle. I carried one of the
eggs home, and, on returning a few days after to the spot, found one of
the birds sitting, which proved to me that the great anxiety shewn at my
first visit was chiefly because the female was about to lay her last egg.
The male was absent, nor did it shew itself during my stay. About a
fortnight after I found the wings of one of the birds near the place; the
eggs also were gone; and I concluded that some quadruped, probably a
racoon, had committed the havock. No bird of this species was in the
neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
In the Fauna Boreali-Americana, Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> says that in high
northern latitudes these birds deposit their eggs on the bare sand, which is
another proof in addition to the many already given, that great differences
as to the mode of nestling may exist in the same species in different parts of
the country. Indeed, almost all the habits of this curious bird differ according
to the locality. In the Southern States, they are particularly fond
of low flat lands among deep woods and cane brakes, and rarely approach
ponds of any great extent, but prefer those which are small and most secluded.
In the Middle Districts I have found them along the Leighhigh,
and in watery places both on low and on elevated ground. In the
State of Maine they frequented similar localities. In the prairies of Indiana
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_577' href='#Page_577'>577</a></span>
I have seen them in early spring, during rainy weather, wading and
running through the water, on the very foot-path before me, for eight or
ten yards at a time. When flushed, they would fly in a semicircle close
over the ground, and re-alight at the distance of a hundred yards or so on
the same path. Not one of the species was observed in Labrador or Newfoundland
by my party; and my friend <span class="smcap">Thomas MacCulloch</span> informs
me that only a few single birds are seen near Pictou, and that in autumn,
when they keep in marshy grounds in the neighbourhood of the sea.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Solitary Sandpiper is swift and protracted. It moves
in a zigzag manner, and at times makes its way through the woods with
surprising ease, seldom leaving the starting place without uttering a clear
and pleasant tweet. In re-alighting it pitches downwards like the Common
Snipe. On the ground they are very active, and at times so indifferent
to the approach of man, that they will merely fly across or around
a small pond for a considerable time, and, if shot at and not touched,
they will be sure to be found in the same place a few hours after. Its
alighting on trees has often appeared to me as singular as that of Bartram’s
Snipe and the Semipalmated species. The Solitary Snipe is, however,
the most expert at catching insects on the wing, especially the smaller
kinds of dragon-flies, which it chases from the sticks on which they alight,
and generally seizes before they have flown across the little ponds, which are
the favourite place of resort of this species. I have found their stomachs
filled with aquatic insects, caterpillars of various kinds, and black spiders
of considerable size.
</p>

<p>
I consider this bird to be a constant resident in the United States,
although it ranges over a great space in summer and winter. Scarcely
any difference is observable in the sexes; and I am of opinion that the
young acquire their full plumage the first spring.

<p>
There is no decided difference between the sexes in the colouring, but
the female is somewhat larger. From the only instance in which I found
this species in the act of depositing its eggs, I conclude that it generally
forms its nest on the higher grounds or along the declivities of hills.

<h2>
THE RED-BACKED SANDPIPER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Tringa alpina</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXC. Male in Summer, and Adult in Winter.</span>
</p>

<p>
In autumn and winter, this species is abundant along the whole range
of our coast, wherever the shores are sandy or muddy, from Maine to the
mouths of the Mississippi; but I never found one far inland. Sometimes
they collect into flocks of several hundred individuals, and are seen wheeling
over the water near the shores or over the beaches, in beautiful order,
and now and then so close together as to afford an excellent shot, especially
when they suddenly alight in a mass near the sportsman, or when, swiftly
veering, they expose their lower parts at the same moment. On such occasions
a dozen or more may be killed at once, provided the proper moment
is chosen.
</p>

<p>
There seems to be a kind of impatience in this bird that prevents it
from remaining any length of time in the same place, and you may see it
scarcely alighted on a sand-bar, fly off without any apparent reason to
another, where it settles, runs for a few moments, and again starts off on
wing. When searching for food they run with great agility, following
the retiring waves, and retreating as they advance, probing the wet sands,
and picking up objects from their surface, ever jerking up the tail, and
now and then uttering a faint cry, pleasant to the ear, and differing from
the kind of scream which they emit while on wing.
</p>

<p>
When I was in the Floridas in winter, I found this species abundant,
and my party shot a great number of them, on account of the fatness and
juiciness of their flesh. They all appeared to have their plumage greyer
than those shot in the Carolinas at the same season, and not one exhibited
the least redness on the back, although that colour is so conspicuous in
spring before they leave us for the north. They usually take their departure
from the south about the first of April, reach the Middle Districts
by the fifteenth of that month, and in a few days assume their summer
plumage. I have observed that at this season the male birds are frequently
in the habit of raising their wings and running in that position for a few
steps, when they close them, and nod to the nearest female. None of the
other sex, however, seemed to take the least notice of this homage. On
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_581' href='#Page_581'>581</a></span>
our way to Labrador we saw flocks of these birds passing, but we found
none breeding in that country. My friend Mr <span class="smcap">Macgillivray</span> has given
me the following account of the habits of this species during the breeding
season.
</p>

<p>
“About the middle of April, the Purres betake themselves to the
moors, in the northern parts of Scotland, and in the larger Hebrides,
where they may be found scattered in the haunts selected by the Golden
Plovers, with which they are so frequently seen in company that they
have obtained the name of Plovers’ Pages. In the Hebrides, from this
season until the end of August, none are to be found along the shores.
The nest is a slight hollow in a dry place, having a few bits of withered
heath and grass irregularly placed in it. The eggs, four in number, are
ovato-pyriform, an inch and four-twelfths in length, eleven-twelfths in
breadth, oil-green or light greenish-yellow, irregularly spotted and blotched
with deep brown, the spots becoming more numerous toward the larger
end, where they are confluent. The young, like those of the Golden Plover
and Lapwing, leave the nest immediately after exclusion, run about,
and when alarmed, conceal themselves by sitting close to the ground and
remaining motionless. If at this period, or during incubation, a person
approaches their retreats, the male especially, but frequently the female
also, flies up to meet the intruder, settles on a tuft near him, or runs along
and uses the same artifices for decoying him from the nest or young as
the Plover or Ring Dotterel. When the young are fledged, the birds
gather into small flocks, which often in the evenings unite into larger, and
join those of the Golden Plover. They rest at night on the smoother
parts of the heath, and both species, when resting by day, either stand or
lie on the ground. When one advances within a hundred yards of such
a flock, it is pleasant to see them stretch up their wings as if preparing
for flight, utter a few low notes, and immediately stand on the alert, or
run a few steps. At this season, however, they are not at all shy. Towards
the end of August, the different colonies betake themselves to
the sandy shores. On a large sand-ford in Harris, I have at this season
seen many thousands at once, running about with extreme activity in
search of food. This place seemed a general rendezvous, and after a few
weeks the host broke up and dispersed, few if any remaining during the
winter.”

<h2>
LABRADOR.
</h2>

<p>
When I look back upon the many pleasant hours that I spent with
the young gentlemen who composed my party, during our excursions
along the coast of sterile and stormy Labrador, I think that a brief account
of our employments may prove not altogether uninteresting to my
readers.
</p>

<p>
We had purchased our stores at Boston, with the aid of my generous
friend Dr <span class="smcap">Parkman</span> of that city; but unfortunately many things necessary
on an expedition like ours were omitted. At Eastport in Maine we
therefore laid in these requisites. No traveller, let me say, ought to neglect
any thing that is calculated to ensure the success of his undertaking,
or to contribute to his personal comfort, when about to set out on a long
and perhaps hazardous voyage. Very few opportunities of replenishing
stores of provision, clothing or ammunition, occur in such a country as
Labrador; and yet, we all placed too much confidence in the zeal and
foresight of our purveyors at Eastport. We had abundance of ammunition,
excellent bread, meat, and potatoes; but the butter was quite
rancid, the oil only fit to grease our guns, the vinegar too liberally diluted
with cider, the mustard and pepper deficient in due pungency. All this,
however, was not discovered until it was too late to be remedied. Several
of the young men were not clothed as hunters should be, and some of the
guns were not so good as we could have wished. We were, however, fortunate
with respect to our vessel, which was a notable sailer, did not leak,
had a good crew, and was directed by a capital seaman.
</p>

<p>
The hold of the schooner was floored, and an entrance made to it
from the cabin, so that in it we had a very good parlour, dining-room,
drawing-room, library, &amp;c. all those apartments however, being, united into
one. An extravagantly elongated deal table ranged along the centre;
one of the party had slung his hammock at one end, and in its vicinity
slept the cook and a lad who acted as armourer. The cabin was small;
but being fitted in the usual manner with side berths, was used for a dormitory.
It contained a small table and a stove, the latter of diminutive
size, but smoky enough to discomfit a host. We had adopted in
a great measure the clothing worn by the American fishermen on that
coast, namely, thick blue cloth trowsers, a comfortable waistcoat, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_585' href='#Page_585'>585</a></span>
pea-jacket of blanket. Our boots were large, round-toed, strong, and
well studded with large nails to prevent sliding on the rocks. Worsted
comforters, thick mittens, and round broad-brimmed hats, completed our
dress, which was more picturesque than fashionable. As soon as we had
an opportunity, the boots were exchanged for Esquimaux mounted mocassins
of seal-skin, impermeable to water, light, easy, and fastening at top
about the middle of the thigh to straps, which when buckled over the hips
secured them well. To complete our equipment, we had several good
boats, one of which was extremely light and adapted for shallow water.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had we reached the coast and got into harbour, than we
agreed to follow certain regulations intended for the general benefit.
Every morning the cook was called before three o’clock. At half-past
three, breakfast was on the table, and every body equipt. The guns,
ammunition, botanical boxes, and baskets for eggs or minerals, were all
in readiness. Our breakfast consisted of coffee, bread, and various other
materials. At four, all except the cook and one seaman, went off in different
directions, not forgetting to carry with them a store of cooked provisions.
Some betook themselves to the islands, others to the deep bays;
the latter on landing wandered over the country, until noon, when laying
themselves down on the rich moss, or sitting on the granite rock, they
would rest for an hour, eat their dinner, and talk of their successes or
disappointments. I often regret that I did not take sketches of the curious
groups formed by my young friends on such occasions, and when, after
returning at night, all were engaged in measuring, weighing, comparing
and dissecting the birds we had procured, operations which were carried
on with the aid of a number of candles thrust into the necks of bottles.
Here one examined the flowers and leaves of a plant, there another
explored the recesses of a diver’s gullet, while a third skinned a gull or a
grous. Nor was our journal forgotten. Arrangements were made for
the morrow, and at twelve we left matters to the management of the cook,
and retired to our roosts.
</p>

<p>
If the wind blew hard, all went on shore, and, excepting on a few remarkably
rainy days, we continued our pursuits much in the same manner
during our stay in the country. The physical powers of the young
men were considered in making our arrangements. <span class="smcap">Shattuck</span> and <span class="smcap">Ingals</span>
went together; the Captain and <span class="smcap">Cooledge</span> were fond of each other,
the latter having also been an officer; <span class="smcap">Lincoln</span> and my son being the
strongest and most determined hunters, generally marched by themselves;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_586' href='#Page_586'>586</a></span>
and I went with one or other of the parties according to circumstances,
although it was by no means my custom to do so regularly, as I had
abundance of work on hand in the vessel.
</p>

<p>
The return of my young companions and the sailors was always
looked for with anxiety. On getting on board, they opened their budgets,
and laid their contents on the deck, amid much merriment, those
who had procured most specimens being laughed at by those who had
obtained the rarest, and the former joking the latter in return. A substantial
meal always awaited them, and fortunate we were in having a
capital cook, although he was a little too fond of the bottle.
</p>

<p>
Our “fourth of July” was kept sacred, and every Saturday night the
toast of “wives and sweethearts” was the first given, “parents and friends”
the last. Never was there a more merry set. Some with the violin and
flute accompanied the voices of the rest, and few moments were spent in
idleness. Before a month had elapsed, the spoils of many a fine bird
hung around the hold; shrubs and flowers were in the press, and I had
several drawings finished, some of which you have seen, and of which I
hope you will ere long see the remainder. Large jars were filling apace
with the bodies of rare birds, fishes, quadrupeds, and reptiles, as well as
molluscous animals. We had several pets too, Gulls, Cormorants, Guillemots,
Puffins, Hawks, and a Raven. In some of the harbours, curious
fishes were hooked in our sight, so clear was the water.
</p>

<p>
We found that camping out at night was extremely uncomfortable,
on account of the annoyance caused by flies and musquitoes, which attacked
the hunters in swarms at all times, but more especially when they
lay down, unless they enveloped themselves in thick smoke, which is not
much more pleasant. Once when camping, the weather became very bad,
and the party was twenty miles distant from Whapatiguan as night
threw her mantle over the earth. The rain fell in torrents, the north-east
wind blew furiously, and the air was extremely cold. The oars of the
boats were fixed so as to support some blankets, and a small fire was with
difficulty kindled, on the embers of which a scanty meal was cooked. How
different from a camp on the shores of the Mississippi, where wood is
abundant, and the air generally not lacking heat, where musquitoes, although
plentiful enough, are not accompanied by carraboo flies, and
where the barkings of a joyful squirrel, or the notes of the Barred Owl,
that grave buffoon of our western woods, never fail to gladden the camper
as he cuts to the right and left such branches and canes as most easily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_587' href='#Page_587'>587</a></span>
supply materials for forming a lodging for the night! On the coast of
Labrador there are no such things; granite and green moss are spread
around, silence like that of the grave envelopes all, and when night has
closed the dreary scene from your sight, the wolves, attracted by the
scent of the remains of your scanty repast, gather around you. Cowards
as they are, they dare not venture on a charge; but their howlings effectually
banish sleep. You must almost roast your feet to keep them
warm, while your head and shoulders are chilled by the blast. When
morning comes, she smiles not on you with rosy cheeks, but appears
muffled in a grey mantle of cold mist, which shews you that there is no
prospect of a fine day. The object of the expedition, which was to procure
some Owls that had been observed there by day, was entirely frustrated.
At early dawn, the party rose stiffened and dispirited, and glad
were they to betake themselves to their boats, and return to their floating
home.
</p>

<p>
Before we left Labrador, several of my young friends began to feel
the want of suitable clothing. The sailors’ ever-tailoring system was, believe
me, fairly put to the test. Patches of various colours ornamented
knees and elbows; our boots were worn out; our greasy garments and
battered hats were in harmony with our tanned and weather-beaten faces;
and, had you met with us, you might have taken us for a squad of wretched
vagrants; but we were joyous in the expectation of a speedy return,
and exulted at the thoughts of our success.
</p>

<p>
As the chill blast that precedes the winter’s tempest thickened the fogs
on the hills and ruffled the dark waters, each successive day saw us more
anxious to leave the dreary wilderness of grim rocks and desolate moss-clad
valleys. Unfavourable winds prevented us for a while from spreading
our white sails; but at last one fair morning smiled on the wintry
world, the Ripley was towed from the harbour, her tackle trimmed, and
as we bounded over the billows, we turned our eyes toward the wilds of
Labrador, and heartily bade them farewell for ever!

<h2>
THE HERRING GULL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Larus argentatus</i>, Brunn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXCI. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 22d of May 1833 I was kindly received with my party on
board the United States revenue-cutter the Swiftsure, commanded by
Captain <span class="smcap">Cooledge</span>, and on the morning of the next day was landed on
White Head Island, at the entrance of the Bay of Fundy. This island
is the property of a worthy Englishman of the name of <span class="smcap">Frankland</span>, who
received us with great hospitality, gave us leave to ransack his domains,
and invited us to remain as long as we pleased. The Herring Gulls, he
said, were breeding in great numbers, and we might expect good sport.
We immediately set out in search of them, directing our course toward
the pine woods, in which we were informed we should find them, and in
approaching which we passed over an elevated marsh of great extent. As
we came up to the place I observed that many of the Gulls had alighted
on the fir-trees, while a vast number were sailing around, and when we
advanced nearer, the former took to wing, abandoning their nests, and all
flew about uttering incessant cries.
</p>

<p>
I was greatly surprised to see the nests placed on the branches, some
near the top, others about the middle or on the lower parts of the trees,
while at the same time there were many on the ground. It is true I had
been informed of this by our captain, but I had almost believed that, on
arriving at the spot, I should find the birds not to be gulls. My doubts,
however, were now dispelled, and I was delighted to see how strangely
Nature had provided them with the means of securing their eggs and
young from their arch-enemy man. My delight was greatly increased on
being afterwards informed by Mr <span class="smcap">Frankland</span> that the strange habit in
question had been acquired by these gulls within his recollection, for, said
he, “when I first came here, many years ago, they all built their nests
on the moss and in open ground; but as my sons and the fishermen collected
most of their eggs for winter use, and sadly annoyed the poor
things, the old ones gradually began to put their nests on the trees in the
thickest parts of the woods. The youngest birds, however, still have
some on the ground, and the whole are becoming less wild since I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_589' href='#Page_589'>589</a></span>
forbidden strangers to rob their nests; for, gentlemen, you are the only
persons out of my family that have fired a gun on White Head Island
for several years past, and I daresay you will not commit any greater havock
among them than is necessary, and to that you are welcome.”
</p>

<p>
I was much pleased with the humanity of our host, and requested him
to let me know when all the Gulls, or the greater part of them, would
abandon the trees and resume their former mode of breeding on the ground,
which he promised to do. But I afterwards found that this was not likely
to happen, because on some other islands not far distant, to which the
fishermen and eggers have free access, these Gulls breed altogether on the
trees, even when their eggs and young are regularly removed every year,
so that their original habits have been entirely given up. My opinion
that, after being thus molested for some time longer, they may resort to
the inaccessible shelves of the high rocks of these islands, was strengthened
by Mr <span class="smcap">Frankland</span>’s informing me that many pairs had already taken
refuge in such places, where they bred in perfect security. The most remarkable
effect produced by these changes of locality is, that the young
which are hatched on the trees or high rocks, do not leave their nests until
they are able to fly, while those on the ground run about in less than
a week, and hide themselves at the sight of man among the moss and
plants, which frequently saves them from being carried away. The young
on the trees are shaken out of their nests, or knocked down with poles,
their flesh being considered as very good by the fishermen and eggers, who
collect and salt them for winter provision.
</p>

<p>
Some of the nests which I saw were placed at a height of more than
forty feet on the trees, others, seen in the thickest parts of the woods, were
eight or ten feet from the ground, and were placed close to the main stem,
so as to be with difficulty observed. It was truly curious to see the broad-winged
birds make their way to and from them in these secluded retreats.
The nests placed on the ground were several yards apart, and measured
from fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter, their cavity being from four
to six. The lower stratum consisted of grass, plants of various kinds,
moss, and grey lichens, and the whole was lined with fine bent, but without
any feathers. Those on the trees measured from twenty-four to
twenty-six inches in diameter externally, and were composed of the same
materials, but in greater quantity, the object of which I thought might
be to allow more space to the young while growing, as they could not enjoy
the pleasure of running about like those hatched on the ground. Perhaps,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_590' href='#Page_590'>590</a></span>
however, the smaller size of the nests placed there may be owing to
their belonging to the younger Gulls, as I have often observed that the
older the individual the larger is its nest. Mr <span class="smcap">Frankland</span> informed me
that they frequently repair the old nests at the commencement of the
breeding season, and I found the assertion proved by my own observation.
The eggs, which are three, measure three inches in length, by two in
breadth, have an oval somewhat pyriform shape, are rough though not
granulated, and are of a dull yellowish earthy colour, irregularly blotched
and spotted with dark umber. They are nearly as large as those of the
Great Black-backed Gull; but they differ considerably in size as well as
in colour, some being more or less rounded or elongated. The yolk is
bright orange, the albumen bluish-white; and they are excellent eating.
</p>

<p>
About the beginning of May the Herring Gulls collect into great
flocks for the purpose of reproducing, and betake themselves to large
sand-bars or mud-flats at low water, where their cacklings may be heard
at a great distance. With the aid of a glass you may see them going
through their courtships; the males swell their throats, walk about proudly,
throw their heads upwards, and emit their love notes. These general
meetings take place at all hours of the day, according to the state of the
tide, and continue for about a fortnight, when they all depart and betake
themselves to the islands on which they breed. Several of these are
situated near the one mentioned, and there is one near Cape Sable, a few
miles from the most southern point of Nova Scotia, on which we saw thousands
alighted on the trees as we were sailing along that coast on our way
to Labrador. Some individuals begin to lay about the 19th of May or a
few days earlier, while others have not finished the process until the middle
of June. During this period they resort at certain hours to bare rocky
islets, on which they copulate. At White Head Island, while we were
seated on the edge of a beautiful sand-bar eating our dinner, we saw, on
one of these rocks, a vast number forming as it were a dense mass, which
covered about half an acre. At twelve o’clock, we observed that all those
which were not sitting on their eggs, flew over us and alighted on the sea,
about half a mile from the shore, where they remained upwards of an hour,
swimming gracefully but in silence all the while. A seal happening to
raise its head above the water frightened them, and all raised their wings
as if about to fly. Soon after they rose all at once, separated, and went
off in search of food, but returned in less than an hour to the island, flying
high and cackling loudly. A little before sunset all those unoccupied
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_591' href='#Page_591'>591</a></span>
with incubation went off to the same rocky islands to roost, flying in silence,
and mostly in files. It was curious to observe that, whenever a large flock
made towards the sea cackling, all the ducks about immediately flew off
to a considerable distance, as if afraid of them; and we saw that these
Gulls, although timorous in the presence of man, shew great courage in
attacking predatory birds, such as Jays, Crows, Ravens, and even Hawks,
which they pursued and forced into the deep woods, or drove away from
the vicinity of their nests.
</p>

<p>
Shy and wary nearly in as great a degree as the Black-backed Gull,
they were with difficulty obtained, unless we approached them under
cover. The least noise made them instantly leave their perch, and although
there were six of us, each furnished with a good gun, and some
sufficiently expert, not more than a dozen were killed that day, and all
of them while flying. The moment one started, it would sound an alarm,
on which hundreds would rise and sail over us, at such a height that it
was useless to shoot at them. Now and then, one accidentally passing
low over the woods, was brought down. While returning in the evening
we shot one at a great height, having merely broken the tip of its wing.
Having caught it, we placed it on the narrow path, on which it ran before
us nearly to the house of the Governor, as Captain <span class="smcap">Frankland</span> is
called. It offered no resistance, but bit severely, and now and then lay
down to rest for a few moments. It ran fast enough to keep several yards
before us, cackling all the while, and once suddenly made off from the path
at a rapid rate.
</p>

<p>
Their flight is as strong as that of the Great Black-backed Gull, but
more buoyant as well as graceful. During the love season their aërial
evolutions are extremely beautiful; they pass through the air in wide circlings,
at a great height, and then come down in curious zigzags until
near the tops of the trees, or the surface of the sea. While in pursuit of
fish, they dart in curved lines with great rapidity, frequently wheeling
suddenly when over their prey, and falling towards it. When travelling,
they pass indifferently over the land or the water, but generally at a considerable
height. Their food consists principally of herrings, of which
they destroy great numbers, following the shoals. They also feed on
other fishes of small size, shrimps, crabs, and shell-fish, as well as on young
birds and small quadrupeds, and suck all the eggs they can find. The
rocky shores of the islands on which I found them breeding are covered
with multitudes of sea-urchins, having short greenish spines, which give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_592' href='#Page_592'>592</a></span>
them the semblance of a ball of moss. At low water the Herring Gulls
frequently devour these animals, thrusting their bill through the shell,
and sucking its contents. They also take up shells in the air, and
drop them on the rocks to break them. We saw one that had met with
a very hard mussel, take it up and drop it three times in succession, before
it succeeded in breaking it, and I was much pleased to see the bird
let it fall each succeeding time from a greater height than before. They
seem to go out to sea in search of food at particular periods, setting out
at the first ebb and returning to the shore as the tide rises.
</p>

<p>
The young are at first fed chiefly with shrimps and other small crustacea,
which are picked up from the mud-bars or along the shores. They
are then of a deep rusty colour all over, and when fully feathered they
retain a good deal of that hue, but the feathers are edged with light grey
or brown; the feet and legs are of a greenish-blue colour, inclining to
purple; the bill dusky or nearly black. In spring they acquire their full
size, but still retain the grey and rusty plumage. The next year they
shew much light ash-grey and white about the head, neck, and lower
parts, the orange spot appears on the bill, the feet and legs are flesh-coloured,
the tail still partially banded towards the extremity. At this
age, however, I believe they breed, as I observed some coloured in the
manner described, mated with older birds. The third spring they acquire
the colouring represented in the plate.
</p>

<p>
I found no other species breeding on the same islands. Old and young
associate together all the year round, excepting during the breeding season,
when the latter separate and pursue their avocations together. The
cry or cackling of this species, which is heard at a considerable distance,
may be imitated by pronouncing the syllables <i>hac</i>, <i>hac</i>, <i>hac</i>, <i>cah</i>,
<i>cah</i>, <i>cah</i>.
</p>

<p>
The Herring Gull has a greater range of migration along our coast
and in the interior than any other American species. I have found it on
our great lakes, and on the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi, down to the
Gulf of Mexico, during the autumnal months, and in winter along the
shores of the latter, and all our eastern coasts. It may be said to be resident
in the United States, as it breeds from off Boston to Eastport in Maine;
but the greater number go farther north. We found the nests of some
on the bare rocks of the Seal Islands off Labrador, but not on the coast
itself. They were composed of dry plants and moss brought from the
mainland. The birds kept by themselves, and appeared to be completely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_593' href='#Page_593'>593</a></span>
mastered by the Great Black-backed Gulls. On our return we saw old
and young on the northern coast of Newfoundland, and on the different
bays over which we passed.
</p>

<p>
I have represented an adult male, but not one of the largest, and a
young bird shot in winter, which I have placed on a bunch of Racoon
oysters, where it was standing when shot.

From the examination of individuals of this species, it would appear
that little reliance can be placed on the markings of the quills as affording
a specific character. Four undoubted specimens of <i>Larus argentatus</i>
now before me, have a white spot, varying in length from one to two
inches, and including both webs, near the end of the <i>first</i> quill. One has
no spot on the <i>second</i> quill; another has a spot on both webs of the <i>second</i>
quill of one wing, and a smaller spot on part of the inner web of the same
quill of the other wing; the third has a very small spot on part of the
inner web of the same quill of both wings; the fourth has a large circular
spot on the inner web of that quill also in both wings.

<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXCII. Male and Female.</span>

<p>
This beautiful species returns from its northern places of residence,
and passes over the Western Country, about the beginning of September.
A few remain on the lower parts of the Ohio, on the Mississippi, and the
lakes in their neighbourhood, but the greater number proceed towards
the Mexican territories. They pass swiftly through the air, at a height
of about a hundred yards, in flocks of from seven or eight to fifty or more,
proceeding in a loose body, and propelling themselves by continued flappings,
their necks and feet stretched out to their full length. I have observed
them thus passing in autumn, for several years in succession, over
different parts of the Ohio, at all hours of the day. On such occasions I
could readily distinguish the old from the young, the former being in
many instances still adorned with their summer head-dress. I never saw
this species near the sea-coast, where, on the contrary, I have met with
the Red-necked Grebe.
</p>

<p>
When about to alight on the water, these birds glide swiftly downward,
with their wings half-closed, and produce a sound not unlike that
of a hawk stooping towards its prey. Their velocity is so great at this
moment, that on alighting, they glide on the surface of the water for
twenty or thirty yards, leaving a furrow in their wake. In a few moments
they are all engaged in washing and cleaning themselves, after
which they dive in pursuit of the fishes on which they feed, and which
they secure by following them in the manner of Divers and Cormorants.
They are exceedingly quick-sighted, and frequently elude by diving the
shot intended for their destruction, seldom after being chased raising
more than their bill above the water, but rarely making for the shore unless
when nearly exhausted.
</p>

<p>
When in ponds, they may easily be caught with fishing hooks placed
on lines near the bottom; but if the lines are not closely attended to, or
held from a place of concealment, where you may feel that they are hooked,
and at once haul them out, the birds drown in a very short time. On
catching two or three in this manner, I found the pond deserted the following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_596' href='#Page_596'>596</a></span>
morning and for several days after. They very rarely fly in your
presence, and they leave the ponds at night. If forced to rise on wing,
they run paddling on the water for several yards before they rise, and
fly several times round a pond of thirty or forty yards before they attain
the level of the tree-tops, for they never fly through the woods. When
once high in the air, they move in a direct course and with speed, towards
some other pond or the nearest river. I do not remember to have ever
met with a bird of this species on a narrow creek or bayou, or on muddy
waters; and on the Ohio’s rising I have observed that they abandon the
river and betake themselves to the clear ponds of the interior.

By the 1st of October, scarcely any difference can be perceived between
the young and the old birds with respect to plumage, only the latter
have the under surface of the wings still dashed with the reddish colour
of the summer dress. I am not able to say from observation how
long the young are in attaining maturity; but European writers assert
that they take three or four years. When these birds leave the southern
waters about the beginning of April, the old already shew their summer
head-dress, but seldom have it so perfect as is represented in the plate.
</p>

<p>
The food of this species consists of fishes, aquatic insects, and small
reptiles, together with the seeds of water plants. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span> states
that these birds are abundant in all the secluded lakes of the mountainous
districts of the fur countries, and adds that their nests are formed of a
large quantity of grass, placed among reeds and carices, and rise and fall
with the water. Mr <span class="smcap">Yarrell</span> has kindly furnished me with specimens
of the eggs, which are generally four, measure two inches and a quarter
in length by one inch and a half, have an oval form, and a smooth surface,
of a uniform yellowish-white colour.

The following account of the digestive organs of this species was taken
from an adult male.
</p>

<p>
The œsophagus is nine and a half inches long; at its commencement,
and for an inch and a half, it has a diameter of half an inch, for the next
two inches only two-twelfths, towards the lower extremity four-twelfths;
this, however, in the contracted state, the specimen having been kept in
spirits. The mucous coat is raised into numerous longitudinal folds.
</p>

<p>
The walls of the proventriculus are extremely thick, the glands cylindrical,
generally about a quarter of an inch long, and one-twelfth in diameter.
The stomach is roundish, compressed, the muscular coat very
thick, being that of a true gizzard, the tendons nearly half an inch in diameter;
the inner coat thick, the cuticular lining very thick and rugous.
</p>

<p>
Between the orifice of the œsophagus and the pylorus is a rounded
lobe, from the lower part of which the intestine comes off. The pylorus
has no valve, but a thick marginal rim. The intestine, immediately after
its commencement, dilates to the diameter of half an inch, and continues
of that size for twelve inches, then gradually contracts for about six inches,
when its diameter is four-twelfths, and again within six inches of the cœca
becomes enlarged. The cœca come off at the distance of two inches from
the anus, and are an inch and a half in length, a little enlarged towards
their extremity, and rounded. The rectum is half an inch in diameter,
the cloaca one inch. The entire length of the intestine is forty-two inches.
</p>

<p>
The heart is conical, rather pointed, and slightly curved. The trachea
is flattened, of uniform diameter, the rings complete, 167 in number, its
transverse diameter two inches and half a twelfth, contracted at the bifurcation
to two-twelfths.
</p>

<p>
The tail of the Grebes is usually described as a small tuft of feathers;
but on carefully removing the coverts and downy parts, the tail may be
satisfactorily traced. In this species there are 14 feathers, on each side
7 arranged in a semicircular manner. The two middle feathers are separated
to the distance of about <span class="fract"><span class="fup">2</span>/<span class="fdn">12</span></span>, and the two outer or lateral approach
each other below, leaving an interval of about the same space. When the
feathers are broken across near their bases, which they frequently are,
there is thus produced the appearance of a small circular tuft. When
perfect, they are about
<span class="mixfract">1&nbsp;<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span>/<span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches long, arched, with loose barbs, downy
at their extremities.

THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.

<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXCIV. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
This Sandpiper is not uncommon along the shores of our Eastern
States in autumn and winter. It has also lately been found in England,
and I have seen a specimen of it in the possession of <span class="smcap">William Yarrell</span>,
Esq. of London, who received it from a person who had shot it not far
from the metropolis. I first met with this species in the immediate vicinity
of Dennisville, in the State of Maine, feeding on the rocky bars of
the river at low water. In the neighbourhood of Boston it is more abundant
than elsewhere. Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span> states, that “they are killed in abundance
on the shores of Cohasset, and other parts of Massachusetts Bay,
and are brought in numbers to the market of Boston, being very fat and
well-flavoured.” “They arrive,” he adds, “in flocks about the close of
August, and continue there, as well as in New Jersey, till the month of
September. In some instances solitary individuals have been killed in
the marshes of Charles River, in Cambridge, about the 22d of July;
these were in company with flocks of small Sandpipers (<i>T. Wilsonii</i>),
but whether pairs may perhaps breed in the neighbouring marshes or not,
we have not had the means of ascertaining. While here, they feed on
small coleoptera, larvæ, and the common green <i>Ulva latissima</i>, as well as
some species of fucus or sea-weed, on which they become fat. They utter
a low plaintive whistle when started, very similar to that of other species.
Like the Snipe they seem fond of damp meadows and marshes, and solitary
individuals are often surprised by the sportsman in the manner of
that bird.”
</p>

<p>
I have observed that the flight of the Pectoral Sandpiper resembles
that of the Knot, and is firm, rapid, and well sustained. It skims rather
low over the surface of the water or the land, and at times shoots high
up into the air, propelling itself with double rapidity and in perfect silence.
It runs with great agility, and probes the sand or wet earth, immersing
its bill up to the base. I never saw this species in any part of
the interior. Its places of resort during the breeding season, and the
changes of plumage which it undergoes, are unknown.

Although I have procured this species to the westward of the banks
of Newfoundland, or between their soundings and the American coast, I
am unable to say any thing of importance respecting its habits as observed
by myself. This species formerly inhabited a small islet close to the Isle
of Man, but appears to have now entirely deserted it. In the Orkneys,
however, it is still abundant, and the eggs and young are in much request
there. It arrives in March, and, when the young are able to fly, betakes
itself to the open sea, disappearing towards the approach of winter. The
British writers who have described it inform us, that it stands nearly erect,
flies with great rapidity, feeds on marine animal substances of all kinds,
and, when taken, squirts out an oily fluid from its nostrils in the manner
of the Petrels. It is said to breed in burrows, and to lay only a single
egg, of a white colour, and elliptical form, about the size of that of a domestic
fowl.

<h2>
GREAT EGG HARBOUR.
</h2>

<p>
Some years ago, after having spent the spring in observing the habits
of the migratory warblers and other land birds, which arrived in vast
numbers in the vicinity of Camden in New Jersey, I prepared to visit
the sea shores of that State, for the purpose of making myself acquainted
with their feathered inhabitants. June had commenced, the weather was
pleasant, and the country seemed to smile in the prospect of bright days
and gentle gales. Fishermen gunners passed daily between Philadelphia
and the various small sea-ports, with Jersey wagons, laden with fish,
fowls and other provisions, or with such articles as were required by the
families of those hardy boatmen; and I bargained with one of them to
take myself and my baggage to Great Egg Harbour.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, about sunset, the vehicle halted at my lodgings, and
the conductor intimated that he was anxious to proceed as quickly as
possible. A trunk, a couple of guns, and such other articles as are found
necessary by persons whose pursuits are similar to mine, were immediately
thrust into the wagon, and were followed by their owner. The
conductor whistled to his steeds and off we went at a round pace over the
loose and deep sand that in almost every part of this State forms the basis
of the roads. After a while we overtook a whole caravan of similar vehicles
moving in the same direction, and when we got near them our
horses slackened their pace to a regular walk, the driver leaped from his
seat, I followed his example, and we presently found ourselves in the
midst of a group of merry wagoners, relating their adventures of the
week, it being now Saturday night. One gave intimation of the number of
“Sheep-heads” he had taken to town, another spoke of the Curlews which
yet remained on the sands, and a third boasted of having gathered so
many dozens of Marsh Hen’s eggs. I inquired if the Fish Hawks were
plentiful near Great Egg Harbour, and was answered by an elderly man,
who with a laugh asked if I had ever seen the “Weak fish” along the coast
without the bird in question. Not knowing the animal he had named, I
confessed my ignorance, when the whole party burst into a loud laugh,
in which, there being nothing better for it, I joined.
</p>

<p>
About midnight the caravan reached a half-way house, where we
rested a while. Several roads diverged from this spot, and the wagons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_607' href='#Page_607'>607</a></span>
separated, one only keeping us company. The night was dark and
gloomy, but the sand of the road indicated our course very distinctly.
Suddenly the gallopping of horses struck my ear, and on looking back
we perceived that our wagon must in an instant be in imminent danger.
The driver leaped off, and drew his steeds aside, barely in time to allow
the runaways to pass without injuring us. Off they went at full speed,
and not long after their owner came up panting, and informed us that they
had suddenly taken fright at some noise proceeding from the woods, but
hoped they would soon stop. Immediately after we heard a crash; then
for a few moments all was silent; but the neighing of the horses presently
assured us that they had broken loose. On reaching the spot, we found
the wagon upset, and a few yards farther on were the horses quietly
browsing by the road side.
</p>

<p>
The first dawn of morn in the Jerseys in the month of June, is worthy
of a better description than I can furnish, and therefore I shall only say
that the moment the sunbeams blazed over the horizon, the loud and
mellow notes of the Meadow Lark saluted our ears. On each side of the
road were open woods, on the tallest trees of which I observed at intervals
the nest of a Fish Hawk, far above which the white-breasted bird
slowly winged its way, as it commenced its early journey to the sea, the
odour of which filled me with delight. In half an hour more, we were
in the centre of Great Egg Harbour.
</p>

<p>
There I had the good fortune to be received into the house of a
thorough bred fisherman-gunner, who besides owning a comfortable cot
only a few hundred yards from the shore, had an excellent woman for a
wife, and a little daughter as playful as a kitten, though as wild as a sea-gull.
In less than half an hour, I was quite at home, and the rest of the
day was spent in devotion.
</p>

<p>
Oysters, though reckoned out of season at this period, are as good as
ever when fresh from their beds, and my first meal was of some as large
and white as any I have eaten. The sight of them placed before me on
a clean table, with an honest and industrious family in my company,
never failed to afford more pleasure than the most sumptuous fare under
different circumstances; and our conversation being simple and harmless,
gaiety shone in every face. As we became better acquainted, I had to
answer several questions relative to the object of my visit. The goodman
rubbed his hands with joy as I spoke of shooting and fishing, and
of long excursions through the swamps and marshes around.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_608' href='#Page_608'>608</a></span>
</p>

<p>
My host was then, and I hope still is, a tall strong-boned muscular
man, of dark complexion, with eyes as keen as those of the Sea-eagle.
He was a tough walker, laughed at difficulties, and could pull an oar with
any man. As to shooting, I have often doubted whether he or Mr
<span class="smcap">Egan</span>, the worthy pilot of Indian Isle, was best; and rarely indeed have
I seen either of them miss a shot.
</p>

<p>
At day-break on Monday, I shouldered my double-barrelled gun,
and my host carried with him a long fowling-piece, a pair of oars, and
a pair of oyster-tongs, while the wife and daughter brought along a seine.
The boat was good, the breeze gentle, and along the inlets we sailed for
parts well known to my companions. To such naturalists as are qualified
to observe many different objects at the same time, Great Egg Harbour
would probably afford as ample a field as any part of our coast, excepting
the Florida Keys. Birds of many kinds are abundant, as are fishes
and testaceous animals. The forests shelter many beautiful plants, and
even on the dryest sand-bar you may see insects of the most brilliant
tints. Our principal object, however, was to procure certain birds known
there by the name of Lawyers, and to accomplish this we entered and
followed for several miles a winding inlet or bayou, which led us to the
interior of a vast marsh, where after some search we found the birds and
their nests. Our seine had been placed across the channel, and when we
returned to it the tide had run out and left in it a number of fine fishes,
some of which we cooked and ate on the spot. One, which I considered
as a curiosity, was saved and transmitted to Baron <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span>. Our repast
ended, the seine was spread out to dry, and we again betook ourselves to
the marshes, to pursue our researches until the return of the tide. Having
collected enough to satisfy us, we took up our oars, and returned to the
shore in front of the fisherman’s house, where we dragged the seine several
times with success.
</p>

<p>
In this manner I passed several weeks along those delightful and
healthy shores, one day going to the woods to search the swamps in which
the Herons bred, passing another amid the joyous cries of the Marsh Hens,
and on a third carrying slaughter among the White-breasted Sea Gulls, by
way of amusement sometimes hauling the fish called the Sheep-head from
an eddy along the shore, or watching the gay Terns as they danced in the
air, or plunged into the waters to seize the tiny fry. Many a drawing I
made at Great Egg Harbour, many a pleasant day I spent along its shores;
and much pleasure would it give me once more to visit the good and
happy family in whose house I resided there.

<p>
Several old gunners on the coast of Massachusetts and Maine, who
were Englishmen by birth, assured me that they had killed Barnacles
there, and that these birds brought a higher price in the markets than the
Common Brent Geese. The Prince of Musignano states in his Synopsis
that they are very rare and accidental in the United States, and Mr <span class="smcap">Nuttall</span>
says that they are “mere stragglers” there. For my part, I acknowledge
that I never met with one of them, either along the coast or
in the interior, although I have seen beautiful mounted specimens in various
parts. Being neither anxious to add to our Fauna, nor willing unnecessarily
to detract from it, I have figured a pair of these birds, with
the hope that ere long, the assertions of the gunners, and those of the
authors above mentioned, may be abundantly verified by the slaughter of
many geese. In the mean time I must further confess my ignorance of
the habits of the Barnacle.
</p>

<p>
Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span> thus speaks of it in the second volume of his Illustrations:—“The
Bernicle is amongst the number of our winter visitants, annually
resorting in vast numbers, upon the approach of autumn, to the western
shores of Britain, and to the north of Ireland. Upon the Lancashire
coast, the Solway Frith, &amp;c. it is very abundant; frequenting the marshy
grounds that are occasionally covered by the spring-tides, and such sands
as produce the sea-grasses and plants upon which it feeds. Upon the
eastern and southern shores of Britain it is of rare occurrence, its place being
supplied by its nearly allied congener, the Brent Goose (<i>Anser Brenta</i>);
which again is as rarely seen upon the opposite coast of the island. Like
the rest of the genus, the Bernicle is a very wary bird, and can only be
approached by the most cautious manœuvres. It is sometimes shot by
moonlight, when it comes on the sands to feed, by persons couched on the
ground, or from behind any occasional shelter in such places as the flocks
are known to frequent. Its flesh is sweet and tender, and highly esteemed
for the table. Upon the approach of spring it leaves our shores for more
northern countries, and by the middle of March the whole have retired.”
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_610' href='#Page_610'>610</a></span>
It is known to breed in Iceland, Spitzbergen, Greenland, &amp;c. as well as in
Lapland, the northern parts of Russia, and northern Asia. It also inhabits
Hudson’s Bay and other polar districts of the American continent.
During its equatorial or winter migration, it is abundant in Holland,
France, and parts of Germany.
</p>

<p>
The eggs, which I describe from specimens deposited in the rich museum
of the University of Edinburgh, measure two inches and seven-eighths
by one inch and seven-eighths, and are of a uniform yellowish-cream
colour.
</p>

I have represented an adult male in spring, and a female of the preceding

<h2>
THE HARLEQUIN DUCK.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Fuligula histrionica</i>, Bonap.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXCVII. Male and Female.</span>
</p>

<p>
I have the pleasure of presenting you with three figures of the Harlequin
Duck, one a male in all the perfection of its spring plumage, the
bird having attained complete maturity, another male two years old, and
an adult female shot in the pairing season. No figures of the adult male
or of the female have, I believe, hitherto been published.
</p>

<p>
To the south of the Bay of Boston the “Lord and Lady Duck” is
rarely seen on our coast; but from that neighbourhood it becomes more
plentiful as you proceed eastward; and, on reaching Maine and the entrance
of the Bay of Fundy, you may see it at any period of the year
among the rocky islands there. It breeds on the Seal, White Head, and
Grand Manan Islands, and along the coast of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton,
Newfoundland, and Labrador. Many, however, proceed much farther
north, for specimens were obtained by Captain <span class="smcap">James Clark Ross</span> in
the highest latitudes visited by him. It is extremely attached to certain
localities, from which it rarely wanders unless greatly molested, and it
thus remains about the islands, or the parts of the coast on which it breeds,
unless it be forced off by very severe weather in winter. Few persons
shoot it for its flesh; not that it is inferior as food to other deep-diving
ducks, but because it is comparatively small, and difficult to be obtained.
Not only is it at all seasons remarkably shy and vigilant, but even if approached
when on rocks, it plunges into the water the moment its keen
eye catches a glance of you, dives with all the agility of the Black Guillemot,
and seldom rises within shot. If you shoot at it when passing on
wing, even should it be beyond reach, it plunges into the water the
moment it perceives the flash,—a habit which is also occasionally observed
in the Black Guillemot. It being usually found in flocks of one
or two families, or of from twelve to fifteen individuals, some one always
acts as a watchful sentinel, whose single note of alarm is sufficient to
induce the whole to move off without hesitation. Notwithstanding all
this vigilance, however, my party procured a good number of them at
different times, by lying in wait for them under cover of some rocks, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_613' href='#Page_613'>613</a></span>
the neighbourhood of which they were known to alight at certain hours
of the day, to bask in the sun and dress their plumage. On these occasions
a shot seldom failed to kill several, for they fly compactly and alight
close together.
</p>

<p>
On the 31st of May 1833, I found them breeding on White Head
Island, and other much smaller places of a similar nature, in the same
part of the Bay of Fundy. There they place their nests under the bushes
or amid the grass, at the distance of twenty or thirty yards from the
water. Farther north, in Newfoundland and Labrador, for example, they
remove from the sea, and betake themselves to small lakes a mile or so in
the interior, on the margins of which they form their nests beneath the
bushes next to the water.
</p>

<p>
The nest is composed of dry plants of various kinds, arranged in a
circular manner to the height of two or three inches, and lined with finer
grasses. The eggs are five or six, rarely more, measure two inches and
one-sixteenth by one inch and four-and-a-half eighths, and are of a plain
greenish-yellow colour. These measurements differ a little from those of
an egg sent to me by my friend Mr <span class="smcap">Hewitson</span> of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
and which had been found in Ireland by Mr <span class="smcap">Atkinson</span>. After the eggs
are laid, the female plucks the down from the lower parts of her body,
and places it beneath and around them, in the same manner as the Eider
Duck and other species of this tribe. The male leaves her to perform the
arduous, but no doubt to her pleasant, task of hatching and rearing the
brood, and, joining his idle companions, returns to the sea-shore, where he
moults in July and August. The little ones leave the nest a few hours
after they burst the shell, and follow their mother to the water, where she
leads them about with the greatest care and anxiety. When about a week
old she walks with them to the sea, where they continue, in the same manner
as the Eiders. When discovered in one of these small inland lakes,
the mother emits a lisping note of admonition, on which she and the
young dive at once, and the latter make for the shores, where they conceal
themselves, while the former rises at a good distance, and immediately
taking to wing, leaves the place for a while. On searching along
the shores for the young, we observed that, on being approached, they
ran to the water and dived towards the opposite side, continuing their endeavours
thus to escape, until so fatigued that we caught four out of six,
When at sea, they are as difficult to be caught as the young Eiders.
</p>

<p>
The flight of the Harlequin Duck is rapid and generally straight. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_614' href='#Page_614'>614</a></span>
sea it flies at a small height, but when flying over the land, or even when
approaching it, should there be any suspicion of danger, it rises to a considerable
height. Its food consists of shrimps, small fishes, roe, aquatic insects,
and mollusca, which it procures by diving. The flesh is dark, and
generally tastes of fish, but that of the female is good during the period
of her sojourn on the fresh-water ponds.
</p>

<p>
The male takes three years to acquire his full plumage, although many
individuals breed in the second year. The female is perfect in the
second spring. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, describes
a male killed on the eastern declivity of the Rocky Mountains,
whence it appears that at times it goes far inland; and it is very probable
that its habits differ greatly in different localities.

THE RED-NECKED GREBE.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Podiceps rubricollis</i>, Lath.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXCVIII. Male and Young.</span>
</p>

<p>
I have found this species along the coast from New York to Maine,
in the winter season, when old and young were generally in about equal
number. At Boston I procured several specimens. On the Bay of Fundy,
and among the islands at its entrance, I saw these Grebes already in their
spring plumage, it being then the beginning of May. On one occasion
our boat was rowed over an eddy in which a pair had dived in search of
food. On emerging they were only a few yards distant; but, although
several guns were fired at them, they escaped unhurt, for they instantly
dived again, passed under the boat at the depth of about a yard, and did
not rise until at a safe distance. None of us could conceive how they had
managed to elude us, for as they were so near, the shot threw up the water
in its course, and I had expected to find them completely mangled.
</p>

<p>
Although I have seen this species far up our salt-water bays, I never observed
it on any of the southern fresh-water ponds or rivers. Dr <span class="smcap">Richardson</span>
states, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, that it “is very common in
the fur countries, frequenting every lake with grassy borders.” M. <span class="smcap">Temminck</span>
says “that they inhabit rivers, lakes, and the borders of the sea, but
in greater number on fresh-waters; are tolerably common in different
parts of Europe; feed on small fish, fry, amphibious reptiles, insects, and
vegetables; form their nests of the same materials, and place it in the
same situations as the Crested Grebe, and lay three or four eggs.” An
egg lent me by my esteemed friend Mr <span class="smcap">Yarrell</span>, measured two inches in
length by one inch and a quarter in breadth, and was of a uniform pale
greenish-white.

<h2>
THE DUSKY PETREL.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Puffinus obscurus</i>, Cuv.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCXCIX. Male.</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of June 1826, while becalmed on the Gulf of Mexico,
off the western shores of Florida, I observed that the birds of this species,
of which some had been seen daily since we left the mouth of the Mississippi,
had become very numerous. The mate of the vessel killed four at
one shot, and, at my request, brought them on board. From one of them
I drew the figure which has been engraved. The notes made at the time
are now before me, and afford me the means of presenting you with a short
account of the habits of this bird.
</p>

<p>
They skim very low over the sea in search of the floating bunches of
marine plants, usually called the Gulf Weed, so abundant here as sometimes
to occupy a space of half an acre or more. In proceeding, they
flap their wings six or seven times in succession, and then sail for three or
four seconds with great ease, having their tail much spread, and their
long wings extended at right angles with the body. On approaching a
mass of weeds, they raise their wings obliquely, drop their legs and feet,
run as it were on the water, and at length alight on the sea, where they
swim with as much ease as ducks, and dive freely, at times passing several
feet under the surface in pursuit of the fishes, which, on perceiving
their enemy, swim off, but are frequently seized with great agility. Four
or five, sometimes fifteen or twenty of these birds, will thus alight, and,
during their stay about the weeds, dive, flutter, and swim, with all the
gaiety of a flock of ducks newly alighted on a pond. Many gulls of different
kinds hover over the spot, vociferating their anger and disappointment
at not being so well qualified for supplying themselves with the same
delicate fare. No sooner have all the fishes disappeared than the Petrels
rise, disperse, and extend their flight in search of more, returning perhaps
in a while to the same spot. I heard no sound or note from any of them,
although many came within twenty yards of the ship and alighted there.
Whenever an individual settled in a spot, many others flew up directly
and joined it. At times, as if by way of resting themselves, they alighted,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_621' href='#Page_621'>621</a></span>
swam lightly, and dipped their bills frequently in the water, in the manner
of Mergansers.
</p>

<p>
I preserved the skins of the four specimens procured. One of them
I sent to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, by Captain
<span class="smcap">John R. Butler</span>, of the ship Thalia, then bound from Havannah to
Minorca. Two others were presented to my excellent friend Dr <span class="smcap">Traill</span>,
on my first becoming acquainted with him at Liverpool.
</p>

<p>
I found the wings of this species strong and muscular for its size, this
structure being essentially requisite for birds that traverse such large expanses
of water, and are liable to be overtaken by heavy squalls. The
stomach resembles a leather purse, four inches in length, and was much
distended with fishes of various kinds, partially digested or entire. The
œsophagus is capable of being greatly expanded. Some of the fishes were
two and a half inches in length, and one in depth. The flesh of this Petrel
was fat, but tough, with a strong smell, and unfit for food; for, on
tasting it, as is my practice, I found it to resemble that of the porpoises.
No difference is perceptible in the sexes.
</p>

<p>
While on board the United States’ Revenue Cutter the Marion, and
in the waters of the Gulf Stream opposite Cape Florida, I saw a flock of
these birds, which, on our sailing among them, would scarcely swim off
from our bows, they being apparently gorged with food. As we were
running at the rate of about ten knots, we procured none of them. I
have also seen this species off Sandy Hook.

<h2>
THE GOLDEN PLOVER.
</h2>
<p class="undertitle">
<span class="smcap"><i>Charadrius pluvialis</i>, Linn.</span>
<br>
<span class="smcap subtitle">PLATE CCC. Adult in Spring and in Winter, and variety.</span>
</p>

<p>
The Golden Plover spends the autumn, winter, and part of the spring,
in various portions of the United States, appearing in considerable numbers
both along the coast and in the interior, and not unfrequently on our
highest grounds. A much greater number, however, proceed in severe winters
beyond the limits of our Southern States, and the partial migrations of
this species are much influenced by the state of the weather. They are
more abundant along the sea shores of the Middle and Eastern Districts,
from the middle of April to the beginning of May, whereas in autumn
they range over the interior, and more especially the western prairies. In
the early part of May they congregate in immense flocks, and commence
their journey toward more northern regions, where they are said to breed.
</p>

<p>
The account which <span class="smcap">Wilson</span> gave of this species refers in part to the
“Bull-headed Plover,” <i>Charadrius helveticus</i>, although his figure cannot be
mistaken for that of the latter, even in its first autumnal dress. But the
Editor of the second edition of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s work has rejected the Golden
Plover as an American Bird, although he might have frequently seen it
in the very markets of Philadelphia. The Prince of Musignano corrected
this error, in his valuable “Observations on the Nomenclature of <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>’s
Ornithology.” Mr <span class="smcap">Selby</span>, in speaking of the Golden Plover, gives
it as his opinion, that the bird so called in America, differs from that of
Europe. This opinion, however, I cannot consider as correct, as I have
seen and examined the Golden Plovers of both countries, and have found
their manners, tone of voice, and appearance, precisely similar.
</p>

<p>
This bird moves on the ground with sprightliness. When observed,
it often runs with considerable rapidity to some distance, suddenly stops
short, nods once or twice, vibrating its body at the same time, and if it
should imagine itself unnoticed, it often lies down and remains crouched
until the danger is over. At the time of their departure from the north,
and while on the sands or mud-bars on the sea shore, they often raise their
wings as if to air them for a few moments. While searching for food,
they move in a direct manner, often look sideways toward the ground, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_624' href='#Page_624'>624</a></span>
pick up the object of their search by a peculiar bending movement of the
body. They are frequently observed to pat the moist earth with their
feet, to force worms from their burrows. In autumn they betake themselves
to the higher grounds, where berries as well as insects are to be met
with, and where they find abundance of grasshoppers.
</p>

<p>
When travelling to a considerable distance, the Golden Plover flies at
the height of from thirty to sixty feet, in a regular manner, with considerable
velocity, the flock, when large, forming an extended front, and
moving with regular flappings, an individual now and then uttering a
mellow note. Before alighting they often perform various evolutions,
now descending and flying swiftly over the ground, then curving upwards
or sidewise, closing and extending their ranks, until the sportsman is often
tired of watching them, and, after all, the flock, just when he expects it
to alight, may suddenly shoot off and fly to a distance. When they alight
within shooting distance, the moment their feet touch the ground is the
critical one, for they are generally in a compact body, and almost immediately
afterwards they disperse. I have often observed them while flying
from one place to another, suddenly check their course for a moment or
two, as if to look at the objects below, in the manner of Curlews.
</p>

<p>
While at New Orleans, on the 16th of March 1821, I was invited by
some French gunners to accompany them to the neighbourhood of Lake
St John, to witness the passage of thousands of these birds, which were
coming from the north-east, and continuing their course. At the first appearance
of the birds early in the morning, the gunners had assembled in
parties of from twenty to fifty at different places, where they knew from
experience that the Plovers would pass. There stationed, at nearly equal
distances from each other, they were sitting on the ground. When a
flock approached, every individual whistled in imitation of the Plover’s
call-note, on which the birds descended, wheeled, and passing within forty
or fifty yards, ran the gauntlet as it were. Every gun went off in succession,
and with such effect that I several times saw a flock of a hundred or
more reduced to a miserable remnant of five or six individuals. The
game was brought up after each volley by the dogs, while their masters
were charging their pieces anew. This sport was continued all day, and
at sunset, when I left one of these lines of gunners, they seemed as intent
on killing more as they were when I arrived. A man near the place where
I was seated had killed sixty-three dozens. I calculated the number in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_625' href='#Page_625'>625</a></span>
the field at two hundred, and supposing each to have shot twenty dozen,
forty-eight thousand Golden Plovers would have fallen that day.
</p>

<p>
On inquiring if these passages were of frequent occurrence, I was told
that six years before, such another had occurred immediately after two
or three days of very warm weather, when they came up with a breeze
from the north-east. Only some of the birds were fat, the greater number
of those which I examined being very lean; scarcely any had food in
their stomach, and the eggs in the ovaries of the females were undeveloped.
The next morning the markets were amply supplied with Plovers at a
very low price.
</p>

<p>
I have again applied to my friend <span class="smcap">William Macgillivray</span> for an
account of the manners of this species during the breeding season, which
I now lay before you.
</p>

<p>
“The Golden Plover is in many parts of Scotland, but especially in
the Northern Highlands, and in the Hebrides, a very common bird.
When the weather begins to improve towards the end of spring, these
birds may be seen flying over the shores or fields in their vicinity, at a
great height, in loose flocks, which now extend into a wide front, now form
irregular angular lines, move with a quiet and regular flight, frequently
emitting their peculiar soft notes, and at times uttering a singular cry,
somewhat resembling the syllables <i>courlie-wee</i>. These flocks are leaving
their winter haunts and returning to the inland moors, over which they
disperse in pairs. In the beginning of May, should you traverse one of
the dreary heaths, you will often hear the plaintive cry of the Plover,
mingling, perhaps, with the feeble cheep of the Dunlin, or the loud
scream of the Curlew. Before you have advanced to any considerable
distance, there may come up and alight on some mossy knoll beside
you, a male, clad in his beautiful summer vesture of black and
green. You may approach him within ten paces if you are inclined,
and in some districts it would be easy for one to shoot many dozens
of them in a day at this season. After incubation has commenced,
the females seldom make their appearance on such occasions. Whether
the males assist their mates at that time or not, they certainly do not forsake
them. The nest is a slight hollow in a tuft of moss, or on a dry
place among the heath, irregularly strewed with fragments of withered
plants. The eggs, of which the full number is four, are placed, as usual
in this genus, with their small ends together. They are much larger and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_626' href='#Page_626'>626</a></span>
more pointed than those of the Lapwing, being at an average two inches
and one-twelfth in length, and an inch and a-half in their greatest transverse
diameter. The shell is thin and smooth, of a light greyish-yellow
or cream-colour, irregularly spotted, dotted and patched with dark brown,
and sometimes having a few light purple spots interspersed, the markings
larger towards the broadest part. The young leave the nest immediately
after they burst the shell, and conceal themselves by lying flat on the
ground. At this period, the female evinces the greatest anxiety for their
safety, and will occasionally feign lameness to entice the intruder to pursue
her. I have several times seen one fly off to a considerable distance,
alight in a conspicuous place, and tumble about as if in the agonies of
death, her wings flapping as if they had been fractured or dislocated.
The eggs are delicious, and the young birds when fledged not less so.
</p>

<p>
“When the young are able to fly, the Plovers collect into flocks, but
remain on the moors until the commencement of winter, when they advance
towards the pasture lands, and in severe weather betake themselves
to the low grounds near the shores. During continued frosts, they feed
on the sands and rocky shores at low water, and in general during the
winter remain at no great distance from the sea.
</p>

<p>
“When a flock alights at this season on a field, the individuals disperse,
run about with great activity, and pick up their food. Sometimes
one finds them so tame that he can approach within fifteen yards, and I
have often walked round a flock several times in order to force them together
before shooting. In windy weather they often rest by lying flat
on the ground, and I have reason to think that at night this is their general
practice. In the Hebrides I have often gone to shoot them at night
by moonlight, when they seemed as actively engaged as by day, which
was also the case with the Snipes; but I seldom succeeded in my object,
it being extremely difficult to estimate distances at night. The numbers
that at this season frequent the sandy pastures and shores of the Outer
Hebrides is astonishing.
</p>

<p>
“The Golden Plover, although occasionally addicted to wading, evidently
prefers dry ground, in which respect it differs essentially in habits
from the <i>Totani</i> and <i>Limosæ</i>. It frequently probes the moist sands, and
in summer the dry cow dung on the moors and upland pastures is seen
perforated by its bill. It affords delicious eating, and in my opinion is
scarcely inferior in this respect to the Woodcock.”

<h2>
REMARKS ON THE FORM OF THE TOES OF
BIRDS.
</h2>

<p>
Although naturalists have laboured, more especially since the time
of the great <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>, who gave an impulse to the study of natural history
unparalleled in that of any other science, to make us acquainted with
animals of every class; and although much has been done by them in
ornithology in particular, it requires little knowledge to be enabled to say
with truth that a great deal more remains to be done. To take an apparently
trivial example, let us look to the tips of the toes of birds, and we
shall no doubt find much that is curious, and much that has been entirely
overlooked. The examination of those parts was suggested to me by
the following occurrence.
</p>

<p>
On the 21st of March 1816, while I was residing at Henderson in
Kentucky, great flocks of Golden Plovers happening to be passing from
their winter toward their summer haunts, I procured a good number of
them. While engaged in drawing a fine specimen, I observed something
beneath the claws, which induced me to look more particularly to that
part of the toes, when I found there what might be called a second but
smaller claw, equally horny with the part properly so called. I examined
several others, and, finding them all alike in this respect, I mentioned
the circumstance to a friend, who agreed with me in thinking it very curious.
Since that period I have generally, on procuring a bird of any
kind, looked to its toes, and I have found many species, both of the genus
<i>Charadrius</i> and of other Grallæ, similarly supplied with double claws.
</p>

<p>
Although I use this term, however, let it not be supposed that I consider
the parts in question as really subsidiary or secondary claws; for
as they are not furnished with a central bone, or process either from the
last phalanx or that next to it, they cannot be truly considered as such,
however much they may sometimes resemble them.
</p>

<p>
But, in order to explain to you what I mean, let us take a general
view of the subject. If we examine the foot of any common land bird, a
domestic fowl for example, we observe that the extremity of its toes under
the nail are rounded, and covered with quincuncial papillæ, generally
flattened. The extreme degree of this rounded form is seen in the <i>Eagles</i>
and <i>Hawks</i>, of which the end of the toe projects beneath the claw, having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_630' href='#Page_630'>630</a></span>
the appearance of a large round knob or rather pad. It is not, however,
my intention at present to describe the structure of this part in the land
birds. I may however remark, that in them, as well as in the others, the
examination of the parts in question will materially aid in limiting the
number of merely nominal species, by disclosing an identity of form, as
well as in separating species that have been confounded, by shewing a diversity,
as I have had occasion to observe, in several species of both kinds.
</p>

<p>
In the aquatic tribes numerous remarkable modifications are observed.
Beginning with those which have the extremity of the toe largest and
most rounded, we find that the <i>Geese</i>, <i>Ducks</i>, and <i>Gulls</i>, supply good examples.
Thus in <i>Larus marinus</i>, the protuberance beneath the claw is
rounded, and covered with small rounded and flattened papillæ, of which
there is a semicircular terminal series of a larger size, as is represented
by fig. 1.
</p>

<div class="figcenter iw006">

  <img src="images/fig3.png" width="554" height="656" alt="">
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">FIG. 3.</span>
  </div></div>

<p>
The <i>Pelicans</i> and <i>Gannets</i> are similar in this respect to the Gulls, as
are the <i>Cormorants</i>, which, however, have the terminal pad projecting
and more pointed. In the <i>Guillemots</i>, also, it is rounded, with small distinct
rounded scales. In the <i>Frigate Bird</i>, in which the webs are short,
and do not modify the pads, the terminal scales are similar to those of
the Gulls. In the genus <i>Lestris</i>, they are smaller, and obscured by the
webs, their papillæ smaller and more pointed. In the Terns, they are
similar to those of the Gulls, but narrower, and with the papillæ large.
In <i>Phaeton æthereus</i>, the webs appear to obliterate the terminal papillæ,
which are very small. In all these, the extremities of the toes are more
or less rounded, and terminated just beneath the claw by a semicircular
series of scales larger than those immediately behind.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>Auks</i>, however, there is a large scale or plate, on the inner
side of the middle toe, and then a series of narrow scales. In <i>Mormon</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_631' href='#Page_631'>631</a></span>
<i>glacialis</i>, of which the end of the middle toe is represented by fig. 2,
there is a single much recurved narrow horny plate, behind which is a
narrow series of oblong scales. In the genus <i>Puffinus</i>, there is also a
single short rounded terminal scale or plate.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Colymbi</i> or <i>Divers</i> have the end of the toe very narrow and flat,
with a single small rounded terminal plate, and numerous small scales
behind it. These birds have the claws depressed, a form which shews
its extreme development in the <i>Grebes</i>. Of the extremity of the middle
toe of one of these, <i>Podiceps cristatus</i>, fig. 3. is a representation. Here
the claw is almost quite flat, and the end of the toe beneath it is not elevated
or rounded as in almost all the other genera, but perfectly depressed,
and having its outline concave, but still, as usual, with a series
of large scales.
</p>

<p>
If we now look to the <i>Grallæ</i>, we shall find similar modifications.
Fig. 4 represents the lower surface, and the lateral aspect of the extremity
of the middle toe of <i>Ardea rufescens</i>, which agrees, in a general
point of view, with that of the other species of the genus, as well as with
that of the <i>Cranes</i>. The pad here is rounded, and terminated by a semicircle
of larger scales. In the genera <i>Numenius</i> and <i>Limosa</i>, the arrangement
is similar, the terminal scales being much smaller in the latter than
in the former, and two of the lateral scales enlarged. In the genera
<i>Tringa</i>, <i>Scolopax</i> and <i>Gallinula</i>, the arrangement is similar. All these
genera exhibit more or less of the rounded form, terminated by a series of
larger scales.
</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">FIG. 6.</span>
  </div></div>

<p>
In <i>Ibis alba</i> the extremity is narrowed and terminated by a small
rather pointed horny plate, divided into two unequal portions, as represented
by fig. 5. The <i>Tantali</i> have this part also narrowed at the end,
flattened, and terminated by a semicircular slightly projecting plate or
hooflet. The same appearance is presented in <i>Hæmatopus palliatus</i>, in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_632' href='#Page_632'>632</a></span>
which, however, the extremity is more rounded, the semicircular plate
more decurved, and concave above, as represented by fig. 6. In <i>Rallus
elegans</i>, fig. 7, and the <i>Rails</i> generally, the terminal plate is similar, but
narrow and rather curved upwards. It is in the genera <i>Strepsilas</i>, <i>Charadrius</i>
and <i>Totanus</i>, that the terminal plate, being narrower, more elongated
and more pointed, assumes more especially the semblance of a second
claw. The extremities of the middle toes of <i>Totanus semipalmatus</i> and
<i>Charadrius Pluvialis</i>, are represented by figs 8. and 9.

<p>
Having now reached the point from which I started, according to the
approved method of reasoning in a circle, or if not, of exhibiting natural
objects in a circular arrangement, I take my leave, hoping that when I
again request your indulgence, I shall be enabled to present you with something
equally curious, and perhaps better calculated to induce you to extend
your inquiries into the neglected parts of the structure of those objects,
whose investigation cannot fail to raise our minds towards the Being who
framed the beautiful and harmonious system of which we form a part.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
